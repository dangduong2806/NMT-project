brother albert barnett and his wife, sister susan barnett, from the west congregation in tuscaloosa, alabama
severe storms ripped through parts of the southern and midwestern united states on january 11 and 12, 2020.
two days of heavy rain, high winds, and numerous tornadoes caused major damage across multiple states.
sadly, brother albert barnett and his wife, sister susan barnett, 85 and 75 years old respectively, were killed when a tornado struck their mobile home.
the united states branch also reports that at least four of our brothers' homes sustained minor damage, along with two kingdom halls.
additionally, the storms caused major damage to a brother's business property.
local elders and the circuit overseer are offering practical and spiritual support to those affected by this disaster.
we know that our heavenly father, jehovah, is providing comfort to our brothers and sisters who are grieving because of this tragedy.
international government agencies and officials have responded to russia's supreme court decision that criminalizes the worship of jehovah's witnesses in russia.
these statements have criticized russia's unjust and harsh judicial action against a minority religious group known for peaceful religious activity.
on july 17, 2017, a three - judge panel of the appellate chamber of russia's supreme court upheld the court's april 20 decision "to liquidate the religious organization 'administrative center of jehovah's witnesses in russia' and the local religious organizations that are part of its structure to turn over to the russian federation all property of the liquidated religious organization."
with this decision, the court effectively banned the worship of jehovah's witnesses throughout russia.
the following are excerpts of statements made after the july 17, 2017, decision by the appellate chamber of russia's supreme court to uphold the april 20 ruling:
we are deeply concerned by the decision of russia's supreme court to reject the appeal of the jehovah's witnesses against their labelling as' extremists. '
this ruling confirms the criminalisation of the peaceful worship of 175.000 russian citizens and contravenes the right to religious freedom that is enshrined in the russian constitution.
- lord ahmad of wimbledon, minister for human rights, foreign and commonwealth office, great britain.
the russian supreme court's decision this week against the jehovah's witnesses is the latest in a disturbing trend of persecution of religious minorities in russia.
we urge the russian authorities to lift the ban on jehovah's witnesses' activities in russia, to reverse the closing of the jehovah's witnesses administrative center, and to release any members of religious minorities that continue to be unjustly detained for so - called 'extremist' activities.
- heather nauert, department spokesperson for the u.s.department of state.
"jehovah's witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the constitution of the russian federation, as well as by russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."
- spokesperson for the european union external action services.
the supreme court's decision sadly reflects the government's continued equating of peaceful religious freedom practice to extremism.
the witnesses are not an extremist group, and should be able to practice their faith openly and freely and without government repression.
- daniel mark, chairman of the united states commission on international religious freedom.
i am very concerned by the fact that the court ban on jehovah's witnesses in russia has been upheld.
despite our appeals on a number of levels, this move makes the peaceful enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion and thought a criminal offence.
- gernot erler, coordinator for intersocietal cooperation with russia, central asia, and the eastern partnership countries, foreign ministry of germany.
russia's recent outrageous decision to ban the jehovah's witnesses from existing as a recognized faith community in russia is a complete violation of the protections for freedom of religion and belief in article 18 of the universal declaration of human rights.
people of goodwill from all faith communities as well as all those who cherish freedom of conscience rights must stand in solidarity with the jehovah's witnesses of russia.
- dr.katrina lantos swett, president, lantos foundation.
prior to the appellate chamber's decision, numerous government agencies and officials condemned the russian supreme court's april 20 ruling:
"i asked president vladimir putin to use his influence to guarantee minority rights here as well as with jehovah's witnesses."
- chancellor angela merkel, during a news conference with president putin.
"the recent decision of the supreme court to declare the jehovah's witnesses administrative center in the russian federation an extremist organisation, and to close it down, together with the 395 local religious organisations used by witnesses, raises serious concerns regarding freedom of religion in russia and is another example of the legislation against extremism being abused to curtail freedom of expression and assembly."
- theodora bakoyannis and liliane maury pasquier, co-rapporteurs of the pace monitoring committee for the russian federation.
russia's failure to respect religious freedom is yet another inexcusable violation of moscow's osce commitments.
people who practice their faith peacefully should never be in danger of being harassed, fined, or jailed.
the court order to seize organization property owned by jehovah's witnesses adds insult to injury.
i am hopeful that this case will be appealed to the european court of human rights.
- senator roger wicker, chairman of the commission on security and cooperation in europe.
yesterday's decision of the supreme court of the russian federation to ban the activities of the administrative centre of jehovah's witnesses in russia on grounds of 'extremism' could make it possible to launch criminal prosecutions against jehovah's witnesses for mere acts of worship.
jehovah's witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the constitution of the russian federation as well as by russia's international commitments and international human rights standards.
i'm deeply concerned by this unwarranted criminalization of the peaceful activities of members of the jehovah's witnesses communities in russia, eliminating this community as a viable entity in the country.
this supreme court decision poses a threat to the values and principles that democratic, free, open, pluralistic and tolerant societies rest upon.
- michael georg link, director of the osce office for democratic institutions and human rights.
this ban persecuting peaceful persons for mere acts of worship clearly violates the fundamental right to religious freedom and with it international human rights standards as also guaranteed by the constitution of the russian federation.
it therefore needs to be revised as soon as possible.
- professor ingeborg gabriel, personal representative of the osce chairperson - in - office on combating racism, xenophobia, and discrimination.
i am alarmed by the decision of russia's supreme court to recognise the jehovah's witnesses as' extremists'.
this ruling effectively criminalizes the peaceful worship of 175,000 russian citizens and contravenes the right to religious freedom which is enshrined in the russian constitution.
the uk calls on the russian government to uphold its international commitment to this basic freedom.
- baroness joyce anelay, former minister of state for the commonwealth and the un at the foreign and commonwealth office.
on july 20, 2017, the permanent council of the osce adopted a statement from the european union (eu).
the statement calls on russia to allow jehovah's witnesses to "be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the constitution of the russian federation as well as by russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."
the statement was unanimously adopted in vienna by all 28 member states of the eu, and other non-eu member countries such as australia, canada, and norway have aligned themselves with it.
jehovah's witnesses worldwide are deeply disappointed that with its arbitrary decision, russia's supreme court has effectively banned their worship throughout the country.
in their responses, international government agencies and officials expose russia for unjustly declaring jehovah's witnesses "extremists" and for ignoring its own constitutional and international commitments to protect religious freedom.
the european court of human rights has yet to hear this matter and will hopefully reverse the nationwide ban.

dismantling saigon's binh trieu tollgates finished
as of monday afternoon, november 2, the hcmc authorities finished dismantling the binh trieu 1 bridge and binh trieu 2 bridge tollgates in thu duc district, which had been nonoperational for four years.
the hcmc infrastructure investment company, investor of the build - operate - transfer (bot) binh trieu bridge – phase 1 project, put the tollgates into operation in 2005 and shut them down in 2016.
the company maintained the tollgates instead of removing them as it planned to use them for the binh trieu bridge – phase 2 project.
however, the city authorities decided to suspend the bot binh trieu bridge – phase 2 project in 2017, therefore the tollgates had been left nonoperational since then.
the nonoperational tollgates were identified as one of the causes of traffic congestion in the city, especially during rush hours.
accidents have been caused by the tollgates as distracted drivers crashed into them.
following the suggestion of the hcmc department of transport, in july 2020 the roads management center has been assigned to the task of removing the tollgates in order to reduce traffic congestion in the area.
15 chinese, vietnamese crew missing after panamanian vessel sinks near central coast
rescue forces are searching for 15 chinese and vietnamese crew of a panamanian ship that sank off binh thuan province today, december 17th.
the ship, carrying clay from malaysia to hong kong, was in the binh thuan sea area at 4:30 p.m. when its captain contacted border guard forces of phu quy island to inform them that the vessel was tilting due to the clay leaning on one side of the ship, the binh thuan border guard force said.
fifteen crew members – 11 chinese and four vietnamese – were on board.
but while it was about 1.5 nautical miles away from the phu quy port, the ship tilted hard and sank.
emergency signals for rescue were continually broadcast from that point.
the binh thuan border defense force and the phu quy search and rescue station dispatched ships to the scene to rescue the crew members.
but no one was found as of 6:30 p.m.
despite rough seas and strong winds near the island, the search is ongoing.
the search radius has been expanded to three to five nautical miles from the scene of the accident, and additional ships have been deployed.
there seem to be myths and superstitions about nearly every aspect of life, and this includes physical attributes.
moles, for example, were considered evidence of guilt during the salem witch trials.
and among the chinese, the shape of your nose is said to reveal whether or not you will be wealthy.
there are also a host of fascinating myths about our present topic: birthmarks.
birthmarks are n't exactly a rare phenomenon.
in fact, about 80 of us are born with these seemingly random markings on our bodies.
there are several different kinds of birthmarks.
as well as brown pigmented types of birthmarks like moles and café au lait spots, there are reddish vascular types ranging in color and form from tiny, pink marks that are flush with the skin, to dark red puffy sorts.
all these reddish (vascular) markings are caused by blood vessels that lie close to the surface of the skin and show through.
even though we know that the blood vessel - clumping makes a birthmark, we do n't know why this happens in the first place.
and this is where all the myth, mysticism and juicy superstition comes in.
first on the docket is the maternal impression myth.
this theory suggests that if a woman experiences an especially strong emotion during pregnancy, her baby may be born with a birthmark.
not only that, but if the woman touches a particular location on her body while experiencing the emotion, that is where the birthmark will appear on her baby's body.
in iranian lore, meanwhile, it is believed that if a woman touches her stomach while watching a solar eclipse, her baby may well have - you guessed it - a birthmark.
other myths center around the colors of food.
for example, if the baby ends up with a red birthmark, it is supposedly because the mother wanted to eat strawberries while she was pregnant.
but, if she wanted to eat jelly or beets, her baby gets a port - wine stain.
chocolate cravings, meanwhile, apparently lead to light brown café au lait spots.
beyond being a result of pregnancy cravings and gazing at eclipses, birthmarks are also said to be omens about people's lives.
if, for example, you happen to have a birthmark on your right arm, you're sure to be prosperous; but, if it's on your left, you're going to have to pinch some pennies.
elsewhere, a left - foot birthmark means the person will be massively intelligent, while if it's on the right, they'll love exploration, adventure and travel.
some birthmarks are also supposedly linked with your manner of death in a previous life.
is that creepy or what?
whether or not you put any stock in these myths and beliefs, they can certainly be a lot of fun to learn about - and possibly exploit.
inventing a story about your death and reincarnation is sure to be a great conversation piece at dinner parties.
or, you can explain the presence of a certain mark by claiming that your mother desired to stroke a goat with her pinky toe while she pregnant with you.
stranger things have happened.
a governing body member shares encouraging scriptural comments, and young ones from around the world share personal expressions.

(new york) vietnamese authorities have detained, interrogated, and even tortured montagnard refugees and asylum seekers who have returned to vietnam from u.n. high commission for refugee (unhcr) camps in cambodia, human rights watch said in a report released today.
the government is violating an agreement with unhcr, which is supposed to monitor returning refugees and ensure they are safe.
drawing on eyewitness accounts and published sources, the 55 - page report, "no sanctuary: ongoing threats to indigenous montagnards in vietnam's central highlands," provides fresh information about ongoing religious and political persecution of montagnards, or indigenous communities, in vietnam's central highlands.
"the vietnamese government continues to persecute montagnards once they are out of the sight of international observers," said brad adams, asia director at human rights watch.
"the international community should oppose their forced return to the central highlands as long as the authorities continue to persecute them."
human rights watch urged the u.n. high commission for refugees to review its participation in promoting and facilitating voluntary repatriation, given the disturbing accounts of mistreatment of returnees, as well as weaknesses in unhcr's monitoring mechanisms.
it also called on the u.s. government to keep vietnam on its list of "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom violations, and urged cambodia to continue to provide temporary asylum to montagnards, in line with its obligations as a signatory to the 1951 refugee convention.
vietnamese officials continue to force montagnard christians to sign pledges renouncing their religion, despite passage of new regulations last year banning such practices.
authorities in some areas restrict freedom of movement between villages – in particular for religious purposes not authorized by the government – and ban christian gatherings in many areas unless they are presided over by officially recognized pastors.
more worrisome, the vietnamese government persists in criminalizing peaceful dissent, unsanctioned religious activity and efforts to seek sanctuary in cambodia, by arresting and imprisoning montagnards who engage in those activities.
the most harshly treated are evangelical christians who belong to independent or unregistered house churches and supporters of a non-violent movement for the protection of, and greater control over, ancestral lands.
more than 350 montagnards have been sentenced to prison since 2001, largely for peaceful political or religious activities.
most have been charged under vietnam's penal code with vaguely worded national security crimes. these include "undermining the unity policy," "disrupting security" and "causing public disorder".
more than 60 montagnards have been imprisoned after being forcibly returned from cambodia, where they were seeking asylum.
the arrests are ongoing: during 2005 alone, at least 142 people – some of whom had been in pre-trial detention for as much as a year – were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.
this is more than double the number imprisoned during the previous year.
at least 30 of those sentenced in 2005 had been arrested in cambodia or near the border areas.
they were apprehended by cambodian police and turned over to vietnamese authorities without having a chance to make an asylum claim with unhcr.
the report includes an annex listing central highland prisoners.
"serious problems persist for montagnards in the central highlands, and the vietnamese government continues to gloss them over," said adams.
for those who think the problems are all in the past, they should think again.
the report includes disturbing testimonies from montagnards who returned to vietnam in 2005 from u.n. refugee camps in cambodia, but then "doubled back" to cambodia after undergoing harsh treatment in vietnam.
they describe in detail being detained, interrogated and even tortured upon return to vietnam.
they also tell of being pressured to recant their religion and threatened not to report any abuses to international delegations and u.n. monitors.
despite this, unhcr has made repeated public statements that returnees are under "no particular threat or duress," and that it has "no serious concerns" about the government's treatment of them.
human rights watch called on the vietnamese government to allow unhcr full and unfettered access to the central highlands, as well as private and confidential meetings with local residents and returnees.
the government should also ensure that there will be no retaliation against those with whom unhcr meets, or their family members.
"these eyewitness accounts make it clear that some returnees have been tortured and persecuted for their religious and political beliefs," said adams.
we have given this information to unhcr.
but it has continued to send people back without the unfettered and confidential access to returnees it needs to protect them properly.
returnees interviewed by human rights watch gave precise accounts of serious threats and intimidation by vietnamese authorities prior to visits by unhcr monitors, who have often been accompanied by vietnamese government officials and police, and are unable to meet privately with returnees.
returnees were warned by authorities not to say anything negative to unhcr officials.
one returnee, who had been beaten and pressured to renounce his religion in police custody, told human rights watch, the un asked about any mistreatment, but i was too afraid to answer.
i told them i had not been hit or threatened.
i did n't dare tell them i'd been sent to prison, if i told, would have beaten me.
"meaningful monitoring can not take place in front of vietnamese officials, or when villagers are threatened not to talk," said adams.
the unhcr monitoring missions and the repatriation program are seriously flawed and need to be reconsidered.
these testimonies, which were shown to unhcr in january 2006, call into question the credibility of its monitoring of returnees and the assumptions on which the memorandum of understanding relating to repatriation is based: that returnees will not be persecuted and that unhcr will be able to monitor the treatment of returnees to ensure that they are not harmed.
more foreign manufacturers turn to vietnam amid pandemic: jll
with the novel coronavirus pandemic and trade tensions driving the shift of production lines from china to southeast asia, vietnam, in particular, seems to have emerged as an attractive destination for investors and manufacturers alike, according to jones lang lasalle (jll) vietnam.
the real estate consultancy said in a recent statement that multinational manufacturers have been setting up operations in vietnam for a number of years and this trend is poised to strengthened.
this movement has accelerated over the past 12 - 24 months, with companies looking to diversify their operations and supply chains due to tariffs on goods exported from china to the united states.
stephen wyatt, country head at jll vietnam, noted that vietnam remains a promising market, with a growing trend during the past few years of manufacturing companies looking to set up operations in the country.
industrial park developers remain confident that demand for land will continue to grow and, therefore, land prices are expected to increase, in line with the long - term potential of vietnam's industrial segment, wyatt said.
companies looking to diversify their manufacturing portfolios outside china are attracted to vietnam, thanks to its proximity to china, free trade agreements and the government's plans to develop vietnam into a manufacturing hub for southeast asia, according to jll's latest market report.
also, the report noted that the average price of land in northern vietnam reached us 99 per square meter per lease term, up 6.5 year - on - year in the first quarter of 2020.
meanwhile, the figure for the southern region was us 101, a year - on - year increase of 12.2, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.
in addition, ready - built factories recorded an average price of us 3.5 - 5 per square meter per month in both regions.
vietnamese man cheats, sending staff to be quarantined in his stead
a businessman on the same flight from hanoi to hue as vietnam's 30th covid - 19 patient sent an employee as his substitute for quarantining.
the substitution was only discovered the next morning, hoang nam, vice chairman of quang tri people's committee said monday.
"he flew on the same flight with 'patient 30' from hanoi to hue," nam said.
the unnamed man is the business head of a company that invests in a wind power project in the central province of quang tri.
after learning of the substitution, authorities requested the man to present himself for quarantine.
he has since been quarantined at the tuberculosis and lung specialist hospital in dong ha town in the province.
at 21:30 friday, four men checked into a hotel in huong hoa district, 65 kilometers west of dong ha town.
they were identified as co-passengers of vietnam's 30th covid - 19 infection on flight vn1547 from hanoi to thua - thien hue.
the men were placed in quarantine sunday.
authorities only discovered there was a replacement the next morning.
huong hoa district authorities are tracking down people the men had come in contact with so as to place them in quarantine, too.
they will also disinfect places visited by the suspects.
the netherlands invented a record speed wifi router
researchers from the eindhoven university of technology, the netherlands have developed successfully a new equipment that permits to transmit wifi with the speed is 300 times faster than that of the ordinary ones.
this device is expected to bring a revolution in using wifi internet.
according to the researchers, the new wifi router operates based on the principle that in which internet data will be distributed by 'light antenna'.
the 'light antenna' mast is responsible for splitting each wavelength of the laser into separate fibers, each fiber can create infrared ray which becomes wifi internet.
professor ton koonen, from the university of science, said, the research team was studying light ray to transmit wifi internet.
ten years ago today, on june 10, 2010, the european court of human rights (echr) ruled that russian authorities had perpetrated a grave violation of human rights with a years - long campaign to suppress our brothers' freedom of worship.
the echr's judgment directed russia to pay a sizable fine and to reinstate the registration of the local religious organization of jehovah's witnesses in moscow - which the authorities revoked in 2004.
immediately after the verdict was announced, brother ivan chaykovskiy, then chairman of the moscow community of jehovah's witnesses, said: this judgment is a victory of common sense over religious intolerance.
i hope that as a result of this judgment, the authorities will quickly restore our legal rights and end the nationwide state - sponsored campaign of harassment against jehovah's witnesses.
that optimism quickly vanished, however, as russian authorities not only failed to abide by the terms of the echr ruling but also escalated their campaign of persecuting our brothers across the federation.
this persecution was dramatically expressed when russia's supreme court effectively banned our peaceful worship in 2017, an injustice that has been followed by numerous arrests, trials, and imprisonments.
although ten years old, much of the court's stinging judgment against russia remains relevant.
in 2010, the echr categorically refuted many of the baseless charges that russia continues to level against our peaceful fellow believers today.
in summary, the echr concluded that the moscow justice department, along with the moscow courts, had 'no legal basis' for refusing the reregistration of jehovah's witnesses. the court decried the moscow authorities, asserting that they 'did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality.'
additionally, moscow authorities were guilty of violating the european convention on human rights, to which russia is a state party.
in 2020, as in 2010, russia's systemic campaign against our brothers is not going unnoticed.
'for jehovah's witnesses in russia, practicing their faith means risking their freedom,' said rachel denber, deputy europe and central asia director for human rights watch.
in a statement dated january 9, 2020, she added: 'there is nothing remotely justifiable about this.'
in the face of injustice, we pray in full confidence that jehovah will continue to strengthen our brothers and sisters in russia to 'endure fully with patience and joy.'

vietnam declared covid - 19 a national epidemic wednesday afternoon.
to date, the covid - 19 pandemic has claimed almost 53,000 lives in 204 countries and territories.
no person coming from any area that has experienced a covid - 19 outbreak will be allowed to enter vietnam, the pm directed tuesday.
prime minister nguyen xuan phuc asked the ministry of foreign affairs to apply the new policy to south korea, japan, italy, iran and all other countries and territories that have reported cases of covid - 19 caused by the novel coronavirus.
vietnam has so far achieved positive results in fighting the covid - 19, but the epidemic has entered its next stage, spreading to many other parts of the world and is now developing complicatedly and unpredictably in south korea, japan, italy and iran, the pm noted.
for those who have to enter vietnam for state affairs or exclusive matters, the government requests them to follow the nation's health declaration procedure and stay in quarantine for 14 days.
citizens of countries stricken by covid - 19, but from cities  provinces free of the epidemic, will have to submit a health declaration and submit to further procedures deemed necessary when entering vietnam.
vietnamese citizens from china's epidemic hit areas can return home, but only via international border gates and will have to be quarantined for two weeks on entry, continuing the policy being followed for the past month.
for its part, the ministry of foreign affairs has called on all vietnamese citizens not to travel to affected areas and if such travel is unavoidable, they have to be quarantined on return.
vietnamese expatriates in epidemic - hit areas have been told to strictly follow regulations and guidance of the local authorities; and advised not to return to vietnam at this time.
deputy pm vu duc dam had said earlier tuesday that in order for the country to achieve the positive results it has so far, vietnam had been proactively implementing measures to prevent and limit the epidemic from mid-december last year, as soon as reports appeared of the covid - 19 in china's wuhan city.
staring february 1, vietnam had suspended all flights to and from china and stopped granting tourist visas to chinese from epidemic - stricken areas.
after south korea raised its disease alert to the 'highest level,' the vietnamese government has tightened controls for visitors from that country.
starting monday, everyone coming in from south korea has to make health declarations, and those with symptoms like high fever, coughing and breathing difficulties will be placed in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.
now all flights from infected areas in south korea will be diverted to smaller airports – van don in the northern quang ninh province, phu cat in the south central binh dinh province and can tho in the mekong delta.
saigon and da nang are currently quarantining 83 people coming on monday from south korea's daegu city, where a major coronavirus outbreak has been detected.
some south koreans who refused to be quarantined has flown home late tuesday night.
south korea is making headlines internationally as one of the worst - hit countries and territories by the coronavirus epidemic, recording 977 infections by tuesday evening, second only to china.
as of tuesday, the last of the 16 infection novel coronavirus infections detected so far in vietnam had fully recovered.
over the past 13 days, no new infection case has been reported in the country.
the covid - 19 is affecting 39 countries and territories.
death toll has crossed 2,700, mostly in china, followed by iran with 15, south korea with 11 and italy with seven.

japan is now testing a robot cooking soba noodles at tokyo station
it is jr east startup co., ltd., that has run an experiment on a robot cooking soba noodles for train passengers at tokyo station recently.
the robot, put at higashi - koganei station on railway co. 's chuo line, is capable of making 40 soba dishes an hour, about the same as a cook's performance.
the robot takes charge of boiling the noodles while the staffs take charge of putting them on a plate and giving them to the customer.
based on the information from the east japan railway company, the trial period might be extended to april 15 with the aim to determine whether the robot can work well enough and satisfy the expectations of its noodle - loving customers or not.
according to a staff, by virtue of the robot, it is possible to beat the kitchen heat in the summer as well as the risk of burning from scalding noodle water.
besides, while the robot boils up noodles, the chef is given an opportunity to have time to do something else, such as dealing with customers, cooking fried food and clearing away dishes.
imagine an airplane flying one millimeter above the ground and circling the earth once every 25 seconds while counting every blade of grass.
shrink all that down so that it fits in the palm of your hand, and you'd have something equivalent to a modern hard drive, an object that can likely hold more information than your local library.
so how does it store so much information in such a small space?
at the heart of every hard drive is a stack of high - speed spinning discs with a recording head flying over each surface.
each disc is coated with a film of microscopic magnetised metal grains, and your data does n't live there in a form you can recognize.
instead, it is recorded as a magnetic pattern formed by groups of those tiny grains.
in each group, also known as a bit, all of the grains have their magnetization's aligned in one of two possible states, which correspond to zeroes and ones.
data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits into electrical current fed through an electromagnet.
this magnet generates a field strong enough to change the direction of the metal grain's magnetization.
once this information is written onto the disc, the drive uses a magnetic reader to turn it back into a useful form, much like a phonograph needle translates a record's grooves into music.
but how can you get so much information out of just zeroes and ones?
well, by putting lots of them together.
for example, a letter is represented in one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo takes up several megabytes, each of which is 8 million bits.
because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed into one square inch.
the area density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that of ibm's first hard drive from 1957.
this amazing advance in storage capacity was n't just a matter of making everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations.
a technique called the thin film lithography process allowed engineers to shrink the reader and writer.
and despite its size, the reader became more sensitive by taking advantage of new discoveries in magnetic and quantum properties of matter.
bits could also be packed closer together thanks to mathematical algorithms that filter out noise from magnetic interference, and find the most likely bit sequences from each chunk of read - back signal.
and thermal expansion control of the head, enabled by placing a heater under the magnetic writer, allowed it to fly less than five nanometers above the disc's surface, about the width of two strands of dna.
for the past several decades, the exponential growth in computer storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as moore's law, which, in 1975, predicted that information density would double every two years.
but at around 100 gigabits per square inch, shrinking the magnetic grains further or cramming them closer together posed a new risk called the superparamagnetic effect.
when a magnetic grain volume is too small, its magnetization is easily disturbed by heat energy and can cause bits to switch unintentionally, leading to data loss.
scientists resolved this limitation in a remarkably simple way: by changing the direction of recording from longitudinal to perpendicular, allowing areal density to approach one terabit per square inch.
recently, the potential limit has been increased yet again through heat assisted magnetic recording.
this uses an even more thermally stable recording medium, whose magnetic resistance is momentarily reduced by heating up a particular spot with a laser and allowing data to be written.
and while those drives are currently in the prototype stage, scientists already have the next potential trick up their sleeves: bit-patterned media, where bit locations are arranged in separate, nano - sized structures, potentially allowing for areal densities of twenty terabits per square inch or more.
so it's thanks to the combined efforts of generations of engineers, material scientists, and quantum physicists that this tool of incredible power and precision can spin in the palm of your hand.
little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death.
a carnivorous plant.
around the world there are more than 600 plant species that supplement a regular diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, or even frogs and rats.
scientists believe that carnivory in plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh - munching adaptation holds a major benefit for plants.
carnivorous plants tend to grow in places with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
in these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely on soil for their nutrients.
take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme.
drawn to the pitcher's vivid colors and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar.
but this pitcher species has an ingredient called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects.
as the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns.
enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher plant can consume through its leaves.
occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the fatal funnel of the pitcher plant.
the second victim faces off with the sticky sundew plant.
the sundew's tiny leaves are equipped with a viscous secretion called mucilage.
the ant is swiftly trapped in this goo.
as she struggles, enzymes begin to digest her body.
special tentacles sense her movement and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip.
once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again to snare their next victim.
two down, four to go.
the next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant.
he enters the roots through a tiny slit in search of food.
but inside, he quickly loses his way through the tangled labyrinth.
a forest of curved hairs prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber with flesh - digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen.
in the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants.
she treads on the bladderwort's trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in.
trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside the plant gets digested.
over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit.
meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by sweet - smelling nectar.
the scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the world's most infamous carnivorous plant.
his landing triggers tiny hairs on the surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap snap shut around him.
the spikes interlock to seal his fate.
once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach that digests the beetle's soft tissues.
when they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his exoskeleton remains.
the mayfly is the last creature standing.
as she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high above the plant's globs of adhesive goo.
she alights on the petals, drinks the nectar, and takes off unscathed.
these long flower stalks keep certain insects away from the carnivore's traps - a way of separating pollinators from food.
off the mayfly buzzes to live a long and fruitful life – oh.
so in my free time outside of twitter i experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools.
and in my job at twitter, i actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with.
and i want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that i think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
but i want to start and go back to the 1930s.
long before a little thing called twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast.
and from those single points emanated stories.
some of them were familiar stories.
some of them were new stories.
and for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium.
think about episodes that happened live on radio.
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format.
and the reason why i bring up radio is that i think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.
and of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world.
this is the map of verified users on twitter and the connections between them.
there are thousands upon thousands of them.
every single one of these points is its own broadcaster.
we've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
and i think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
i actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the internet will allow us to create.
i believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods.
the short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.
one writer, hugh howey, experimented with short stories on amazon by releasing one very short story called "wool."
and he actually says that he did n't intend for "wool" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more.
he gave them "wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one, "wool 3," which was even longer, culminating in "wool 5," which was a 60,000 - word novel.
i think howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e - books.
he was able to write and publish in relatively short order.
there was no mediator between him and the audience.
it was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him.
so this whole project was an experiment.
it started with the one short story, and i think the experimentation actually became a part of howey's format.
and that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.
this is a short story by the author jennifer egan called "black box."
it was originally written specifically with twitter in mind.
egan convinced the new yorker to start a new yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created.
now twitter, of course, has a 140 - character limit.
egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by the new yorker.
every night, at 8 p. m, you could tune in to a short story from the new yorker's fiction account.
i think that's pretty exciting: tune - in literary fiction.
the experience of egan's story, of course, like anything on twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.
you could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them.
they were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, the new yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.
another great example of fiction and the short story on twitter, elliott holt is an author who wrote a story called "evidence."
it began with this tweet: "on november 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as miranda brown, 44, of brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a manhattan hotel."
it begins in elliott's voice, but then elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of elsa, margot and simon, characters that elliott created on twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p. m.
when this woman falls to her death.
these three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives.
one reviewer called elliott's story "twitter fiction done right," because she did.
she captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.
interestingly, though, it was n't just twitter as a distribution mechanism.
it was also twitter as a production mechanism.
elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.
she laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line.
i think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on twitter.
as you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world.
things like invisible obama or the famous "binders full of women" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of "west wing" twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in "the west wing," including the bird that taps at josh lyman's window in one single episode.
(laughter) all of these are rapid iterations on a theme.
they are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
you look at something like "west wing" twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world.
they comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of congress.
keep in mind, they're all democrats.
and they engage with the real world.
they respond to it.
so once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.
so during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account.
it was mayor emanuel.
it gave you everything you wanted from rahm emanuel, particularly in the expletive department.
this foul - mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went.
it followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid twitter parody account, but then started to get weird.
and as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real - time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, rahm emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is -- it did n't actually happen.
i double checked the newspapers.
and then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
this is something that does n't usually happen with a twitter parody account.
it ended, a true narrative conclusion.
and so the author, dan sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, i think dan -- it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and i think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.
one of my favorite examples of something that's happening on twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist crimer show.
crimer show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show.
crimer show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the u.k., but, man, is it weird.
and there are all these times where crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these tv things.
he's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text.
i think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each crimer show as an episode, spelled e - p - p - a - s - o - d, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new.
there is a new "eppasod" of crimer show on twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way.
and i think this is an interesting experiment in format.
something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.
i think in nonfiction real - time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.
realtimewwii is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day.
and the author teju cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news.
in this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
i think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.
so with real - time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and i think that they're just the building blocks.
they are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.
you're lifting weights.
the first time feels easy, but each lift takes more and more effort until you ca n't continue.
inside your arms, the muscles responsible for the lifting have become unable to contract.
why do our muscles get fatigued?
we often blame lactic acid or running out of energy, but these factors alone do n't account for muscle fatigue.
there's another major contributor: the muscle's ability to respond to signals from the brain.
to understand the roots of muscle fatigue, it helps to know how a muscle contracts in response to a signal from a nerve.
these signals travel from the brain to the muscles in a fraction of a second via long, thin cells called motor neurons.
the motor neuron and the muscle cell are separated by a tiny gap, and the exchange of particles across this gap enables the contraction.
on one side of the gap, the motor neuron contains a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.
on the other side, charged particles, or ions, line the muscle cell's membrane: potassium on the inside, and sodium on the outside.
in response to a signal from the brain, the motor neuron releases acetylcholine, which triggers pores on the muscle cell membrane to open.
sodium flows in, and potassium flows out.
the flux of these charged particles is a crucial step for muscle contraction: the change in charge creates an electrical signal called an action potential that spreads through the muscle cell, stimulating the release of calcium that's stored inside it.
this flood of calcium causes the muscle to contract by enabling proteins buried in the muscle fibers to lock together and ratchet towards each other, pulling the muscle tight.
the energy used to power the contraction comes from a molecule called atp.
atp also helps pump the ions back across the membrane afterward, resetting the balance of sodium and potassium on either side.
this whole process repeats every time a muscle contracts.
with each contraction, energy in the form of atp gets used up, waste products like lactic acid are generated, and some ions drift away from the muscle's cell membrane, leaving a smaller and smaller group behind.
though muscle cells use up atp as they contract repeatedly, they are always making more, so most of the time even heavily fatigued muscles still have not depleted this energy source.
and though many waste products are acidic, fatigued muscles still maintain p h within normal limits, indicating that the tissue is effectively clearing these wastes.
but eventually, over the course of repeated contractions there may not be sufficient concentrations of potassium, sodium or calcium ions immediately available near the muscle cell membrane to reset the system properly.
so even if the brain sends a signal, the muscle cell ca n't generate the action potential necessary to contract.
even when ions like sodium, potassium or calcium are depleted in or around the muscle cell, these ions are plentiful elsewhere in the body.
with a little time, they will flow back to the areas where they're needed, sometimes with the help of active sodium and potassium pumps.
so if you pause and rest, muscle fatigue will subside as these ions replenish throughout the muscle.
that's because the stronger you are, the fewer times this cycle of nerve signal from the brain to contraction in the muscle has to be repeated to lift a certain amount of weight.
fewer cycles means slower ion depletion, so as your physical fitness improves, you can exercise for longer at the same intensity.
many muscles grow with exercise, and larger muscles also have bigger stores of atp and a higher capacity to clear waste, pushing fatigue even farther into the future.
economists have been exploring people's behavior for hundreds of years: how we make decisions, how we act individually and in groups, how we exchange value.
they've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade, like legal systems, corporations, marketplaces.
but there is a new, technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value, and it's called the blockchain.
now, that's a pretty bold statement, but if you take nothing else away from this talk, i actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new, it's also a continuation of a very human story, and the story is this.
as humans, we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value.
now, one of the first people to really explore the idea of institutions as a tool in economics to lower our uncertainties about one another and be able to do trade was the nobel economist douglass north.
he passed away at the end of 2015, but north pioneered what's called "new institutional economics."
and what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution, and informal constraints, like bribery.
these institutions are really the grease that allow our economic wheels to function, and we can see this play out over the course of human history.
if we think back to when we were hunter - gatherer economies, we really just traded within our village structure.
we had some informal constraints in place, but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions.
as our societies grew more complex and our trade routes grew more distant, we built up more formal institutions, institutions like banks for currency, governments, corporations.
these institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew, and our personal control was much lower.
eventually with the internet, we put these same institutions online.
we built platform marketplaces like amazon, ebay, alibaba, just faster institutions that act as middlemen to facilitate human economic activity.
as douglass north saw it, institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society.
and i believe we are now entering a further and radical evolution of how we interact and trade, because for the first time, we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions, like our banks, our corporations, our governments, but we can do it with technology alone.
so what is the blockchain?
blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer - to - peer network.
it's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what.
the transactions are secured through cryptography, and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured.
this creates an immutable, unforgeable record of all of the transactions across this network.
this record is replicated on every computer that uses the network.
it's not an app.
it's not a company.
i think it's closest in description to something like wikipedia.
we can see everything on wikipedia.
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated.
we can also track those changes over time on wikipedia, and we can create our own wikis, because at their core, they're just a data infrastructure.
on wikipedia, it's an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time.
on the blockchain, you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets.
it stores the history of custodianship, ownership and location for assets like the digital currency bitcoin, other digital assets like a title of ownership of ip.
it could be a certificate, a contract, real world objects, even personal identifiable information.
there are of course other technical details to the blockchain, but at it s core, that's how it works.
it's this public registry that stores transactions in a network and is replicated so that it's very secure and hard to tamper with.
which brings me to my point of how blockchains lower uncertainty and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways.
so uncertainty is kind of a big term in economics, but i want to go through three forms of it that we face in almost all of our everyday transactions, where blockchains can play a role.
we face uncertainties like not knowing who we're dealing with, not having visibility into a transaction and not having recourse if things go wrong.
so let's take the first example, not knowing who we're dealing with.
say i want to buy a used smartphone on ebay.
the first thing i'm going to do is look up who i'm buying from.
are they a power user?
do they have great reviews and ratings, or do they have no profile at all?
reviews, ratings, checkmarks: these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we're dealing with.
but the problem is they're very fragmented.
think about how many profiles you have.
blockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source.
this allows us to create a user - controlled portable identity.
more than a profile, it means you can selectively reveal the different attributes about you that help facilitate trade or interaction, for instance that a government issued you an id, or that you're over 21, by revealing the cryptographic proof that these details exist and are signed off on.
having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way.
so i've talked about how blockchains could lower uncertainty in who we're dealing with.
the second uncertainty that we often face is just not having transparency into our interactions.
say you're going to send me that smartphone by mail.
i want some degree of transparency.
i want to know that the product i bought is the same one that arrives in the mail and that there's some record for how it got to me.
this is true not just for electronics like smartphones, but for many kinds of goods and data, things like medicine, luxury goods, any kind of data or product that we do n't want tampered with.
the problem in many companies, especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone, is they're managing all of these different vendors across a horizontal supply chain.
all of these people that go into making a product, they do n't have the same database.
they do n't use the same infrastructure, and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time.
using the blockchain, we can create a shared reality across nontrusting entities.
by this i mean all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other or trust each other, because they each have the ability to monitor and validate the chain for themselves.
think back to wikipedia.
it's a shared database, and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time, it has one single truth.
so we can create that using blockchains.
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority.
so all of these vendors, all sorts of companies, can interact using the same database without trusting one another.
it means for consumers, we can have a lot more transparency.
as a real - world object travels along, we can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain, adding value as it goes.
this is a whole new world in terms of our visibility.
so i've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades, like in a supply chain.
the last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open - ended, and it's reneging.
what if you do n't send me the smartphone?
can i get my money back?
blockchains allow us to write code, binding contracts, between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer.
so if we look at the smartphone example, you could think about escrow.
you are financing that phone, but you do n't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met.
you got the phone.
i think this is one of the most exciting ways that blockchains lower our uncertainties, because it means to some degree we can collapse institutions and their enforcement.
it means a lot of human economic activity can get collateralized and automated, and push a lot of human intervention to the edges, the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.
i think what would probably floor douglass north about this use of technology is the fact that the very thing that makes it work, the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified, is our mutual distrust.
so rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks, our governments, our corporations, we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open.
now, i do n't want you to get the impression that the blockchain is the solution to everything, even though the media has said that it's going to end world poverty, it's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem and potentially save the rainforest.
the truth is, this technology is in its infancy, and we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place and probably fail before we truly understand all of the use cases for our economy.
but there are tons of people working on this, from financial institutions to technology companies, start - ups and universities.
and one of the reasons is that it's not just an economic evolution.
it's also an innovation in computer science.
blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange, of exchange of currency, of all kinds of digital and physical assets, even of our own personal attributes, in a totally new way.
so in some ways, they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we're used to using in society, but it does this in a decentralized way.
it does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties into certainties.
so i think we need to start preparing ourselves, because we are about to face a world where distributed, autonomous institutions have quite a significant role.
(applause) bruno giussani: thank you, bettina.
i think i understood that it's coming, it offers a lot of potential, and it's complex.
what is your estimate for the rate of adoption?
bettina warburg: i think that's a really good question.
my lab is pretty much focused on going the enterprise and government route first, because in reality, blockchain is a complex technology.
how many of you actually understand how the internet works?
but you use it every day, so i think we're sort of facing the same john sculley idea of technology should either be invisible or beautiful, and blockchain is kind of neither of those things right now, so it's better suited for either really early adopters who kind of get it and can tinker around or for finding those best use cases like identity or asset tracking or smart contracts that can be used at that level of an enterprise or government.
bg: thank you.
thanks for coming to ted.
bw: thanks.

what do these animals have in common?
more than you might think.
along with over 5,000 other species, they're mammals, or members of class mammalia.
all mammals are vertebrates, meaning they have backbones.
but mammals are distinguished from other vertebrates by a number of shared features.
that includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk.
but despite these similarities, these creatures also have many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable is how they give birth.
let's start with the most familiar, placental mammals.
this group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale, the biggest animal on earth.
its placenta, a solid disk of blood - rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus to support the developing embryo.
directly connected to the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste.
placental mammals can spend far longer inside the womb than other mammals.
baby blue whales, for instance, spend almost a full year inside their mother.
the placenta keeps the calf alive right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over.
measuring about 23 feet, a newborn calf is already able to swim.
it will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of its mothers thick, fatty milk per day.
meanwhile, in australia, you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials.
marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate when they're born that they must continue developing in the mother's pouch.
take the quoll, one of the world's smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains.
the kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single jelly bean - sized baby at a time.
the baby crawls down the middle of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends the next 6 - 11 months suckling.
even after the baby kangaroo leaves this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk.
sometimes, she's just one of three babies her mother is caring for.
a female kangaroo can often simultaneously support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch.
when that happens, she's able to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey.
the word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce milk from nipples in their pouches, they do n't actually have breasts.
nor do monotremes, the third and arguably strangest example of mammalian birth.
there were once hundreds of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas and the duck - billed platypus.
the name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use for reproduction, excretion, and egg - laying.
like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.
their eggs are soft - shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough to feed themselves.
despite laying eggs and other adaptations that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck - bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals.
that's because they share the defining characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked to the rest of the class.
whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.
professor fukanō, the famous eccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop in a plane of his own design.
able to travel consistently at the incredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours to circle the world.
there's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters of fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey.
let's be honest.
the professor probably could have designed the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that?
instead, he's devised a slightly more elaborate solution: building three identical planes for the mission.
in addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them with a few other incredible features.
each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount of its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other.
the professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants fugōri and orokana will pilot each of the others.
however, only one airport, located on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where the planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground.
how should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously for the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out of fuel and crashing?
pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself.
answer in: 3 answer in: 2 answer in: 1 according to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off by a hair.
the key is to maximize the support each assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel.
it also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips in either direction while setting the professor up for a long unsupported stretch in the middle.
here's his solution.
all three planes take off at noon flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters.
after 45 minutes, or one - eighth of the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left.
orokana gives 45 to the professor and 45 to fugōri, fully refueling them both.
with her remaining 45, orokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge for a well - deserved break.
45 minutes later, with one - quarter of the trip complete, the professor and fugōri are both at 135 kiloliters again.
fugōri transfers 45 into the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90 he needs to return.
professor fukanō stretches and puts on his favorite album.
he'll be alone for a while.
in the meantime, orokana has been anxiously awaiting fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go.
as soon as his plane touches the ground, she takes off, this time flying east.
at this point, exactly 180 minutes have passed and the professor is at the halfway point of his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left.
for the next 90 minutes, the professor and orokana's planes fly towards each other, meeting at the three - quarter mark.
just as the professor's fuel is about the run out, he sees orokana's plane.
she gives him 45 kiloliters of her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each.
but that's just half of what they need to make it to the airport.
fortunately, this is exactly when fugōri, having refueled, takes off.
45 minutes later, just as the other two planes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel to each, leaving 45 for himself.
all three planes land at the airport just as their fuel gauges reach zero.
as the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will soon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how to keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.
i, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on earth who live in cities.
and there are days -- i do n't know about the rest of you -- but there are days when i palpably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life.
and some days, that can even be a little scary.
but what i'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues, if we apply open - source collaboration.
a couple of years ago, i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan, in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment.
now at the time that i was reading this, it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment.
so i was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future.
but that was actually exactly the point that michael pollan was making in this article -- it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system.
so, i happen to know a little bit from my own work about how nasa has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space.
and that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high - quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.
now to a vegetable plant, my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space.
but i can offer some natural light and year - round climate control.
fast - forward two years later: we now have window farms, which are vertical, hydroponic platforms for food - growing indoors.
and the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom, which periodically sends this liquid nutrient solution up to the top, which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved.
now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate, so a window farm requires a farmer, and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm, and whether she is going to feed her food organically.
back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing.
and i really wanted it to be an open project, because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the united states right now, and could possibly become another area like monsanto, where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food.
so i decided that, instead of creating a product, what i was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers.
the first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.
we were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical new york city apartment window.
and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
but the first few systems were these leaky, loud power - guzzlers that martha stewart would definitely never have approved.
(laughter) so to bring on more codevelopers, what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs, we explained how they worked, and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems.
and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us.
so actually now on this website, we have 18,000 people.
and we have window farms all over the world.
what we're doing is what nasa or a large corporation would call r d, or research and development.
but what we call it is rd - i - y, or "research and develop it yourself."
(laughter) so, for example, jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps.
it took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half.
tony in chicago has been taking on growing experiments, like lots of other window farmers, and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low - light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients.
and window farmers in finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the finnish winters by outfitting them with led grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project.
so window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software.
and with every open source project, the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns, and the universal concerns.
so my core team and i are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone.
and we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers.
so for do - it - yourselfers, we provide free, very well - tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free.
and there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community.
and to fund the project, we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who do n't have time to build their own systems.
now within our community, a certain culture has appeared.
in our culture, it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy.
what we get out of this project is support for our own work, as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs.
but i think that eleen expresses best what we really get out of this, which is the actual joy of collaboration.
so she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea, built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing.
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people, maybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer" and get behind the people who are doing stuff.
open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own.
and what we're seeing is that rd - i - y has moved beyond just window farms and leds into solar panels and aquaponic systems.
and we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us.
and we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now.
so we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united, and to declare that we are all still pioneers.
i'm denice frohman, and this is "accents."
my mom holds her accent like a shotgun, with two good hands.
her tongue, all brass knuckle slipping in between her lips her hips, are all laughter and wind clap.
she speaks a sanchocho of spanish and english, pushing up and against one another, in rapid fire there is no telling my mama to be "quiet," my mama do n't know "quiet."
her voice is one size better fit all and you best not tell her to hush, she waited too many years for her voice to arrive to be told it needed house keeping.
english sits in her mouth remixed so "strawberry" becomes "eh-strawbeddy" and "cookie" becomes "eh-cookie" and kitchen, key chain, and chicken all sound the same.
my mama does n't say "yes" she says, "ah ha" and suddenly the sky in her mouth becomes a hector lavoe song.
her tongue ca n't lay itself down flat enough for the english language, it got too much hip too much bone too much conga too much cuatro to two step got too many piano keys in between her teeth, it got too much clave too much hand clap got too much salsa to sit still it be an anxious child wanting to make play - doh out of concrete english be too neat for her kind of wonderful.
her words spill in conversation between women whose hands are all they got sometimes our hands are all we got and accents that remind us that we are still bomba, still plena you say "wepa" and a stranger becomes your hermano, you say "dale" and a crowd becomes a family reunion.
my mother's tongue is a telegram from her mother decorated with the coqui's of el campo so even when her lips can barely stretch themselves around english, her accent is a stubborn compass always pointing her towards home.
everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.
our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes.
as we design these things, we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds, and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems.
our bodies are home to trillions of microbes, and these creatures define who we are.
the microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.
the microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.
the microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath, or not, and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.
so, for example, when you touch a pencil, microbial exchange happens.
if we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings, this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways.
i get asked all of the time from people, "is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"
and i believe the answer is yes.
i think we're doing it right now, but we're doing it unconsciously.
i'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how, through both conscious and unconscious design, we're impacting these invisible worlds.
this is the lillis business complex at the university of oregon, and i worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building.
we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building, and to do this, we sampled dust.
from the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells, broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.
this is a picture of tim, who, right when i snapped this picture, reminded me, he said, "jessica, the last lab group i worked in i was doing fieldwork in the costa rican rainforest, and things have changed dramatically for me."
so i'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices, and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that i've been working on in partnership with autodesk.
the way that you look at this data is, first, look around the outside of the circle.
you'll see broad bacterial groups, and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe, it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.
so at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.
let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.
if you look inside the restrooms, they all have really similar ecosystems, and if you were to look inside the classrooms, those also have similar ecosystems.
but if you look across these space types, you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another.
i like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.
i told tim, "if you could just see the microbes, it's kind of like being in costa rica.
kind of.
and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.
this perspective is a really powerful one for designers, because you can bring on principles of ecology, and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal, the way organisms move around.
we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air.
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system.
mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right.
they do this using principles of physics and chemistry, but they could also be using biology.
if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building, you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.
and if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit, you'll see that they're fundamentally different.
the rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.
another facet of how microbes get around is by people, and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people, or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.
given that microbes travel around with people, you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes.
and that is exactly what we found.
if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another, they have very similar ecosystems, but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away, the ecosystem is fundamentally different.
and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns, it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems, like hospital - acquired infections.
i believe this has got to be, in part, a building ecology problem.
all right, i'm going to tell you one more story about this building.
i am collaborating with charlie brown.
he's an architect, and charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.
he's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building, he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.
he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health.
he helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated.
so what i'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building.
what you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.
next i'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.
we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation.
a lot of buildings are operated this way, probably where you work, and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.
what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday, when we opened the vents up again.
when you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before.
contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers.
in these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well, and when charlie saw this, he got really excited.
he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.
the examples that i just gave you are about architecture, but they're relevant to the design of anything.
imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone.
there's a new microbe, i just discovered it.
it's called blis, and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath.
would n't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones?
a conscious approach to design, i'm calling it bioinformed design, and i think it's possible.
so i begin with an advertisement inspired by george orwell that apple ran in 1984.
(video) big brother: we are one people with one will, one resolve, one cause.
our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will fight them with their own confusion.
we shall prevail.
narrator: on january 24th, apple computer will introduce macintosh.
and you'll see why 1984 wo n't be like "1984."
rebecca mackinnon: so the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today.
technology created by innovative companies will set us all free.
fast - forward more than two decades: apple launches the iphone in china and censors the dalai lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the chinese government for its chinese app store.
the american political cartoonist mark fiore also had his satire application censored in the united states because some of apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
his app was n't reinstated until he won the pulitzer prize.
the german magazine stern, a news magazine, had its app censored because the apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users, and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout germany.
and more controversially, recently, apple censored a palestinian protest app after the israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
so here's the thing.
we have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies.
or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed.
or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many, or most, of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question.
so here's the situation.
in a pre-internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation - states.
but now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace.
and their decisions about software coding, engineering, design, terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and can not do with our digital lives.
and their sovereignties, cross - cutting, globally interlinked, can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation - states in very exciting ways, but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and can not do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world.
after all, even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year.
and these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in tunisia and egypt this past spring and beyond.
as wael ghonim, the google - egyptian - executive by day, secret - facebook - activist by night, famously said to cnn after mubarak stepped down, "if you want to liberate a society, just give them the internet."
but overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated.
on the left there's a photo taken by an egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the egyptian state security offices in march.
and many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles.
but some of the files were left behind intact, and activists, some of them, found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges, their cellphone text message exchanges, even skype conversations.
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the egyptian security forces.
and egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
and in tunisia, censorship actually began to return in may -- not nearly as extensively as under president ben ali.
but you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence.
in protest over this, blogger slim amamou, who had been jailed under ben ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution, he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
but there's been a lot of debate in tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem.
in fact, on twitter, there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said, "well actually, we do want democracy and free expression, but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off - bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
but the problem is, how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power?
as riadh guerfali, the veteran digital activist from tunisia, remarked over this incident, "before, things were simple: you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
today, things are a lot more subtle.
the reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks.
in fact, in the united states, whatever you may think of julian assange, even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the united states government and some companies have handled wikileaks.
amazon webhosting dropped wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from u.s. senator joe lieberman, despite the fact that wikileaks had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime.
so we assume that the internet is a border - busting technology.
this is a map of social networks worldwide, and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing, depending on how you like the way facebook manages its service.
but borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace.
in brazil and japan, it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
but if you look at china, vietnam and a number of the former soviet states, what's happening there is more troubling.
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where, effectively, the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government.
now in china, you have the "great firewall," as it's well - known, that blocks facebook and twitter and now google  and many of the other overseas websites.
and that's done in part with the help from western technology.
but that's only half of the story.
the other part of the story are requirements that the chinese government places on all companies operating on the chinese internet, known as a system of self - discipline.
in plain english, that means censorship and surveillance of their users.
and this is a ceremony i actually attended in 2009 where the internet society of china presented awards to the top 20 chinese companies that are best at exercising self - discipline -- i.e. policing their content.
and robin li, ceo of baidu, china's dominant search engine, was one of the recipients.
in russia, they do not generally block the internet and directly censor websites.
but this is a website called rospil that's an anti-corruption site.
and earlier this year, there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to rospil through a payments processing system called yandex money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at yandex money.
this has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable.
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the internet, which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services.
so the important question, i think, is not this debate over whether the internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
of course, it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
the most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the internet evolves in a citizen - centric manner.
because i think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens, and i would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives, not to manipulate or enslave us.
so the question is, we know how to hold government accountable.
we do n't necessarily always do it very well, but we have a sense of what the models are, politically and institutionally, to do that.
how do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most ceo's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit?
and government regulation often is n't helping all that much.
you have situations, for instance, in france where president sarkozy tells the ceo's of internet companies, "we're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest."
but then he goes and champions laws like the infamous "three- strikes" law that would disconnect citizens from the internet for file sharing, which has been condemned by the u.n. special rapporteur on freedom of expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications, and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
and here in the united kingdom there's also concern over a law called the digital economy act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior.
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen - centric internet in the future, we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement.
after all, companies did n't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course, or employing 10 - year - olds as a matter of course, just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do.
it was the result of decades of sustained activism, shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy.
similarly, governments do n't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day.
it's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations, and that you get the right corporate behavior.
we need to make the same approach with the internet.
we also are going to need political innovation.
eight hundred years ago, approximately, the barons of england decided that the divine right of kings was no longer working for them so well, and they forced king john to sign the magna carta, which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules.
this set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation, which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in america across the pond.
so now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked.
at the moment, we still do n't know.
but it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics, on geopolitics, but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management, investor behavior, consumer choice and even software design and engineering.
each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around.
(applause)
being a child, and sort of crawling around the house, i remember these turkish carpets, and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.
i mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier.
and my mom took these pictures actually, last week, of our carpets, and i remember this to this day.
there was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity -- pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.
what i remember today from this is that objects tell stories, so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.
and then there was another influence.
i was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, i guess like all teenagers, we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.
and so, i fused together the two things i loved the most, which was skiing and windsurfing.
those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in switzerland.
so, i created this compilation of the two: i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there, and some foot straps, and some metal fins, and here i was, going really fast on frozen lakes.
it was really a death trap.
i mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.
and i realized then i had to go to design school.
(laughter) i mean, look at those graphics there.
(laughter) so, i went to design school, and it was the early '90s when i finished.
and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley, so i wanted to be there, and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes, that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.
and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, "well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."
and they would give the projects code names, you know, mostly from "star wars," actually: things like c3po, yoda, luke.
so, in anticipation, i would be this young designer in the back of the room, and i would raise my hand, and i would ask questions.
i mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions, but things like, "what's this caps lock key for?"
or "what's this num lock key for?"
you know, that thing?
you know, do people really use it?
do they need it?
do they want it in their homes? "
(laughter) what i realized then is, they did n't really want to change the legacy stuff; they did n't want to change the insides.
they were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins, to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.
and i did n't want to be a colorist.
it was n't what i wanted to do.
i did n't want to be a stylist in this way.
and then i saw this quote: "advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."
(laughter) so, i had to start on my own.
so i moved to san francisco, and i started a little company, fuseproject.
and what i wanted to work on is important stuff.
and i wanted to really not just work on the skins, but i wanted to work on the entire human experience.
and so the first projects were sort of humble, but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way, and maybe finding some new functionality.
this is a watch we made for mini cooper, the car company, right when it launched, and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical.
and that allows me to check my timer discretely, here, without bending my elbow.
and other projects, which were really about transformation, about matching the human need.
this is a little piece of furniture for an italian manufacturer, and it ships completely flat, and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and what not.
and something a little bit more experimental: this is a light fixture for swarovski, and what it does is, it changes shape.
so, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.
and just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.
and then finally, the leaf lamp for herman miller.
this is a pretty involved process; it took us about four and a half years.
but i really was looking for creating a unique experience of light, a new experience of light.
so, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.
and that's a unique opportunity, i would say, in design.
and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light.
so, the light bulb actually does that.
it allows the person to switch, and to mix these two colorations.
and it's done in a very simple way: one just touches the base of the light, and on one side, you can mix the brightness, and on the other, the coloration of the light.
so, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as i'm going to show, on some civic - type projects.
because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business, value to the users also, but i think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value.
and the values we bring can be about environmental issues, about sustainability, about lower power consumption.
you know, they can be about function and beauty; they can be about business strategy.
but designers are really the glue that brings these things together.
so jawbone is a project that you're familiar with, and it has a humanistic technology.
it feels your skin. it rests on your skin, and it knows when it is you're talking.
and by knowing when it is you're talking, it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about, which is the environmental noises.
but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can.
i mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it is n't beautiful, it really does n't belong on your face.
and this is what we're pursuing here.
but how we work on jawbone is really unique.
i want to point at something here, on the left.
this is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work.
but this is the design process: there's somebody changing the board, putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ics, as the designers on the other side are doing the work.
so, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.
it's really about designing from the inside out.
and then, on the other side of the room, the designers are making small adjustments, sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.
and it's what i call being design driven.
you know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out.
and then, of course, design is never done.
and this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff.
the packaging, and the website, and you need to continue to really touch the user, in many ways.
but how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?
and hosain rahman, the ceo of aliph jawbone, you know, really understands that you need a different structure.
so, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners, it's a partnership.
we can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project, and then we also share in the rewards.
and here's another project, another partnership - type approach.
this is called y water, and it's this guy from los angeles, thomas arndt, austrian originally, who came to us, and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink, or an organic drink for his kids, to replace the high - sugar - content sodas that he's trying to get them away from.
so, we worked on this bottle, and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
the bottles connect together, and you can create different shapes, different forms.
(laughter) (applause) thank you.
(applause) and then while we were doing this, the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a y, and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not," are probably the most important words that kids ask.
so we called it y water. and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room: the three - dimensional design, the ideas, the branding, it all becomes deeply connected.
and then the other thing about this project is, we bring intellectual property, we bring a marketing approach, we bring all this stuff, but i think, at the end of the day, what we bring is these values, and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.
and it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor, when others can be creative and do more with it.
here's another project, which i think really emulates that.
this is the one laptop per child, the 100 laptop.
this picture is incredible.
in nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.
this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.
i mean, to me, it just means so much.
but when nicholas negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot, he's the founder of olpc -- came to us about two and a half years ago, there were some clear ideas.
he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology, and those are pillars of his life, but also pillars of the mission of one laptop per child.
but the third pillar that he talked about was design.
and at the time, i was n't really working on computers.
i did n't really want to, from the previous adventure.
but what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust.
and plus, he said he was going to get rid of the caps lock key -- (laughter) -- and the num lock key, too.
so, i was convinced.
we designed it to be iconic, to look different. to look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
and then the integration of all these great technologies, which you've heard about, the wi - fi antennas that allow the kids to connect; the screen, which you can read in sunlight; the keyboard, which is made out of rubber, and it's protected from the environment.
you know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the olpc people and the engineers.
they fought the suppliers, they fought the manufacturers.
i mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is.
and in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea.
and i think this is something really important.
so, now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay with their computers, and in mongolia.
and we went away from obviously the beige.
i mean it's colorful, it's fun.
in fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
it's because we were able to run, during the manufacturing process, 20 colors for the x and the o, which is the name of the computer, and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor, you get 20 times 20: you get 400 different options there.
so, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible.
but this is my nephew, anthony, in switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and i had to take it back.
it was hard.
(laughter) and it was a prototype.
and a month and a half later, i come back to switzerland, and there he is playing with his own version.
(laughter) like paper, paper and cardboard.
so, i'm going to finish with one last project, and this is a little bit more of adult play.
(laughter) some of you might have heard about the new york city condom.
it's actually just launched, actually launched on valentine's day, february 14, about 10 days ago.
so, the department of health in new york came to us, and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of new york.
so a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.
these are the dispensers.
there's this friendly shape.
it's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant, and it has to be easily serviceable: you have to know where it is and what it does.
and we also designed the condoms themselves.
and i was just in new york at the launch, and i went to see all these places where they're installed: this is at a puerto rican little mom - and - pop store; at a bar in christopher street; at a pool hall.
i mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.
and here's the public service announcement for this project.
(music) (laughter) get some.
(applause) so, this is really where design is able to create a conversation.
i was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them.
they were excited.
it was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and i think that's also what design can do.
so, i was going to throw some condoms in the room and what not, but i'm not sure it's the etiquette here.
(laughter) yeah? all right, all right.
i have only a few.
(laughter) (applause) so, i have more, you can always ask me for some more later.
(laughter) and if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom, you can just say you like the design.
(laughter) so, i'll finish with just one thought: if we all work together on creating value, but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do, i think we can change the work that we do.
we can change these values, can change the companies we work with, and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.
so, thank you.
what if you could only see one color?
imagine, for instance, that you could only see things that were red and that everything else was completely invisible to you.
as it turns out, that's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light.
different kinds of light are all around you everyday but are invisible to the human eye, from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs, to the x - rays doctors use to see inside of you, to the microwaves that heat up your food.
in order to understand how these can all be light, we'll need to know a thing or two about what light is.
light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like both a wave and a particle.
light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean.
there are big waves and small waves, waves that crash on the shore one right after the other, and waves that only roll in every so often.
the size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency.
imagine being a boat in that ocean, bobbing up and down as the waves go by.
if the waves that day have long wavelengths, they'll make you bob only so often, or at a low frequency.
if the waves, instead, have short wavelengths, they'll be close together, and you'll bob up and down much more often, at a high frequency.
different kinds of light are all waves, they just have different wavelengths and frequencies.
if you know the wavelength or frequency of a wave of light, you can also figure out it s energy.
long wavelengths have low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies.
it's easy to remember if you think about being in that boat.
if you were out sailing on a day with short, choppy waves, you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself, running around to keep things from falling over.
but on a long wavelength sea, you'd be rolling along, relaxed, low energy.
the energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter, for example, the cells of our eyes.
when we see, it's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the retina.
our retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so we call that range of light visible light.
inside our retina are special receptors called rods and cones.
the rods measure brightness, so we know how much light there is.
the cones are in charge of what color of light we see because different cones are sensitive to different energies of light.
some cones are more excited by light that is long wavelength and low energy, and other cones are more excited by short wavelength, high - energy light.
when light hits our eye, the relative amount of energy each cone measures signals our brain to perceive colors.
the rainbow we perceive is actually visible light in order of its energy.
at one side of the rainbow is low - energy light we see as red, and at the other side is high - energy light we see as blue.
if light shines on us that has an energy our retina ca n't measure, we wo n't be able to see it.
light that is too short wavelength or high energy gets absorbed by the eye's surface before it can even get to the retina, and light that is too long wavelength does n't have enough energy to stimulate our retina at all.
the only thing that makes one kind of light different from another is its wavelength.
radio waves have long wavelengths, while x - rays have short wavelengths.
and visible light, the kind you can actually see, is somewhere in between.
even though our eyes ca n't detect light outside of the visible range, we can build special detectors that are stimulated by these other wavelengths of light, kind of like digital eyes.
with these devices, we can measure the light that is there, even though we ca n't see it ourselves.
even though they seem different, the warmth you feel from a crackling fire is the same as the sun shining on you on a beautiful day, the same as ultraviolet light you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from, the same thing as your tv, your radio, and your microwave.
now, those examples are all things here on earth, things you experience in your everyday life, but here's something even more amazing.
when you think of the night sky, you probably think of being able to see the stars shining with your own eyes, but that's just visible light, which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum.
if we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light, it would be like having only one crayon -- pretty sad.
to see the universe in its full spectrum, we need to have the right eyes, and that means using special telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light.
you've probably heard of the hubble space telescope and seen its beautiful pictures taken in visible and ultraviolet light.
but you might not know that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit, missions that can each see part of the full spectrum of light.
with telescopes acting as our virtual eyes, both in space and here on earth, we can see some amazing things.
and the coolest thing of all, no matter the wavelength or energy, the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on earth.
so, since we know the physics of how x - ray, ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy and know what kinds of things are happening there too.
so, as you go about your daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and ca n't see.
knowing just a little bit about the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum around you all the time.
our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.
of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism.
however, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that i've just elucidated.
more importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long - term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development.
the fundamental question is this: how are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the united states and across europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?
they continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity.
in particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling.
in a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?
in these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation.
and yet today, the largest emerging economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.
worse than that, countries like india, russia, south africa, brazil and even china are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing.
economic growth matters.
with economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.
without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.
economic growth matters powerfully for the individual.
if growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.
the context matters.
and countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.
now, i know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.
there are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth.
you worry about the overpopulation of the planet.
and looking at the un's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals.
you are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.
and you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt.
but i'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world.
and more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
the definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
it's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism.
economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly.
and as i mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.
and even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy.
capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.
when in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum.
and we have countries such as china, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the unites states which are more market capitalist.
our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like china that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
however, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the united states.
this is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
the two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.
in order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today?
very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer -- a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.
and only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts.
of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods.
but nevertheless, this framework -- this two - stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.
i would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.
first of all, we can draw on the right - wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.
in particular, right - leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth.
for example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.
now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like mexico, in brazil and also in pilot programs in new york.
but there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left - leaning policies.
arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of china.
but also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs.
things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction.
of course, left - leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, ngos and private sector.
two very good examples of this are the 19th - century united states, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public - private partnerships.
more recently, of course, the advent of the internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.
my fundamental message to you is this: we can not continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological.
in order to create sustainable, long - term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad - minded about what might work.
ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.
(applause) bruno giussani: i want to ask a couple of questions, dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times.
what do you say to those who react that way?
dm: well, i think that that's completely legitimate, and i think that we're already having that discussion.
there's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards.
and so i think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world.
bg: so you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources.
do you see that happening?
dm: well, i think that i'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity.
i think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is.
however, we've seen the club of rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid.
but i think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, i think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes.
and so in that sense, i'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.
bg: the thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues.
is that what you're suggesting?
dm: i'm suggesting we have to be open - minded.
i think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to.
and i think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the united states, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance.
the second largest economy is china.
it has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model.
these two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a gini coefficient.
i think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and i think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we do n't know.
bg: one last question.
the cop21 is going on in paris.
if you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?
dm: again, i would be very much about being open - minded.
as you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now -- in copenhagen, '72 in stockholm -- and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want.
emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we do n't have political uncertainty in the those countries.
developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their co2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in rd.
and so they have to come to the table as well.
but in essence, it can not be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets.
bg: dambisa, thank you for coming to ted.
dm: thank you very much.
statistics are persuasive.
so much so that people, organizations, and whole countries base some of their most important decisions on organized data.
but there's a problem with that.
any set of statistics might have something lurking inside it, something that can turn the results completely upside down.
for example, imagine you need to choose between two hospitals for an elderly relative's surgery.
out of each hospital's last 1000 patient's, 900 survived at hospital a, while only 800 survived at hospital b.
so it looks like hospital a is the better choice.
but before you make your decision, remember that not all patients arrive at the hospital with the same level of health.
and if we divide each hospital's last 1000 patients into those who arrived in good health and those who arrived in poor health, the picture starts to look very different.
hospital a had only 100 patients who arrived in poor health, of which 30 survived.
but hospital b had 400, and they were able to save 210.
so hospital b is the better choice for patients who arrive at hospital in poor health, with a survival rate of 52.5.
and what if your relative's health is good when she arrives at the hospital?
strangely enough, hospital b is still the better choice, with a survival rate of over 98.
so how can hospital a have a better overall survival rate if hospital b has better survival rates for patients in each of the two groups?
what we've stumbled upon is a case of simpson's paradox, where the same set of data can appear to show opposite trends depending on how it's grouped.
this often occurs when aggregated data hides a conditional variable, sometimes known as a lurking variable, which is a hidden additional factor that significantly influences results.
here, the hidden factor is the relative proportion of patients who arrive in good or poor health.
simpson's paradox is n't just a hypothetical scenario.
it pops up from time to time in the real world, sometimes in important contexts.
one study in the uk appeared to show that smokers had a higher survival rate than nonsmokers over a twenty - year time period.
that is, until dividing the participants by age group showed that the nonsmokers were significantly older on average, and thus, more likely to die during the trial period, precisely because they were living longer in general.
here, the age groups are the lurking variable, and are vital to correctly interpret the data.
in another example, an analysis of florida's death penalty cases seemed to reveal no racial disparity in sentencing between black and white defendants convicted of murder.
but dividing the cases by the race of the victim told a different story.
in either situation, black defendants were more likely to be sentenced to death.
the slightly higher overall sentencing rate for white defendants was due to the fact that cases with white victims were more likely to elicit a death sentence than cases where the victim was black, and most murders occurred between people of the same race.
so how do we avoid falling for the paradox?
unfortunately, there's no one - size - fits - all answer.
data can be grouped and divided in any number of ways, and overall numbers may sometimes give a more accurate picture than data divided into misleading or arbitrary categories.
all we can do is carefully study the actual situations the statistics describe and consider whether lurking variables may be present.
otherwise, we leave ourselves vulnerable to those who would use data to manipulate others and promote their own agendas.
it's a diagram of the visual system.
and some things look very familiar today.
two eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.
there's a very large nose that does n't seem to be connected to anything in particular.
and if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system, you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years.
and that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain, rather than just looking at its overall shape.
imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.
you really would be kind of out of luck.
you want to be able to open it up, crack it open, look at the wiring inside.
and up until a little more than a century ago, nobody was able to do that with the brain.
nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.
and that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it, put it under even a very powerful microscope, there's nothing there.
it's gray, formless.
there's no structure.
it wo n't tell you anything.
and this all changed in the late 19th century.
suddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.
the computer was cracked open.
so what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the golgi stain.
and it works in a very particular way.
instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them.
it clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.
if everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.
spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramon y cajal, who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience, applied this golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this, and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.
and if you're thinking of the brain as a computer, this is the transistor.
and very quickly cajal realized that neurons do n't operate alone, but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer.
today, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons, they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.
and there's several ways of doing this.
but one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein.
now green fluorescent protein, which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish, is very useful.
because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell, that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein, you get a cell to glow many different colors.
and so coming back to the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "brainbow."
and it's so called, of course, because all of these neurons are glowing different colors.
now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons, molecules, rather than the entire cell.
and there's several ways of doing this, but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies.
and you're familiar, of course, with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.
but it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules, like, for example, the coat protein of a virus that's invading the body.
and researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain, recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually.
and a lot of the images i've been showing you here are very beautiful, but they're also very powerful.
they have great explanatory power.
this, for example, is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.
and you've heard of serotonin, of course, in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.
you've heard of ssris, which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.
and in order to understand how serotonin works, it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.
and antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question.
i'd like to leave you with the following thought: green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get - go.
they were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason, or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.
and only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say, "hey, these are tools, these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette."
and instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch, there were these ready - made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all.
i was raised in seoul, korea, and moved to new york city in 1999 to attend college.
i was pre-med at the time, and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
at the same time, i fell in love with new york city.
i started to realize that i could look at the whole city as a living organism.
i wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers.
and the way to it, for me, was through artistic means.
so, eventually i decided to pursue an mfa instead of an m.d.
and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
in new york city, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.
most people ignore them or are frightened of them.
but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society.
and even though they're used in labs to promote human lives, they're also considered pests.
i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them.
one day, in the subway, i was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two, and a man came up to me and said, "you ca n't take photographs here.
the mta will confiscate your camera. "
i'll follow the rats. "
then i started going into the tunnels, which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people do n't get to see.
around the same time, i met like - minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers, guerrilla historians, etc.
i was welcomed into this loose, internet - based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, aqueducts, factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
when i took photographs in these locations, i felt there was something missing in the pictures.
simply documenting these soon - to - be - demolished structures was n't enough for me.
so i wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself.
i decided against clothing because i wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time - specific elements.
i wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook, brooklyn.
it's now an empty, six - acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new ikea.
i was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex i found on my own that is abandoned.
when i first went in, i was scared, because i heard dogs barking and i thought they were guard dogs.
but they happened to be wild dogs living there, and it was right by the water, so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
and, in a way, i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature.
when i got comfortable in the space, it also felt like a big playground.
i would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if i went back in time and became a child again.
this was taken in the old croton aqueduct, which supplied fresh water to new york city for the first time.
the construction began in 1837.
it lasted about five years.
it got abandoned when the new croton aqueducts opened in 1890.
when you go into spaces like this, you're directly accessing the past, because they sit untouched for decades.
i love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
instead of looking at reproductions of it at home, you're actually feeling the hand - laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
this is a tunnel underneath riverside park.
it was built in the 1930s by robert moses.
the murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains.
walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
there's nobody around you, and you hear the kids playing in the park above you, completely unaware of what's underneath.
when i was going out a lot to these places, i was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because i was in a solitary phase in my life, and i decided to title my series "naked city spleen," which references charles baudelaire.
"naked city" is a nickname for new york, and "spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
this is the same tunnel.
you see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching.
this is a tunnel that's abandoned in hell's kitchen.
i was there alone, setting up, and a homeless man approached.
i was basically intruding in his living space.
i was really frightened at first, but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and he did n't seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on self - timer and ran back and forth.
and when i was done, he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out.
it must have been a very unusual day for him.
(laughter) one thing that struck me, after this incident, was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
that homeless man, to me, really represented an element of the unconscious of the city.
he told me that he was abused above ground and was once in riker's island, and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
the tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city, but is now a sanctuary for outcasts, who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
this is underneath my alma mater, columbia university.
the tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the manhattan project.
this particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of bloomingdale insane asylum, which was demolished in 1890 when columbia moved in.
this is the new york city farm colony, which was a poorhouse in staten island from the 1890s to the 1930s.
most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades, but this is an exception.
this children's hospital was closed in 1997; it's located in newark.
when i was there three years ago, the windows were broken and the walls were peeling, but everything was left there as it was.
you see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x - ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table.
after exploring recently - abandoned buildings, i felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast: your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church -- any man - made structures around you.
i was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are.
i love to travel, and berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
it's full of history, and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war.
this was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
i saw the structure while i was on the train, and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb - like basement, which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also, at some point, to hide groups of jewish refugees.
this is the actual catacombs in paris.
i explored there extensively in the off - limits areas and fell in love right away.
there are more than 185 miles of tunnels, and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
the first tunnels date back to 60 b.c.
they were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century, the caving - in of some of these quarries posed safety threats, so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place.
as you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
it's very dangerous to get lost in there.
and at the same time, there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
so the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries, making them into the catacombs.
the remains of over six million people are housed in there, some over 1,300 years old.
this was taken under the montparnasse cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located.
there are also phone cables that were used in the '50s and many bunkers from the world war ii era.
this is a german bunker.
nearby there's a french bunker, and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met.
the tunnels are famous for having been used by the resistance, which victor hugo wrote about in "les miserables."
and i saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
after exploring the underground of paris, i decided to climb up, and i climbed a gothic monument that's right in the middle of paris.
this is the tower of saint jacques.
it was built in the early 1500s.
i do n't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of january, naked.
it was not very comfortable.
(laughter) and all this time, i never saw a single rat in any of these places, until recently, when i was in the london sewers.
this was probably the toughest place to explore.
i had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- i guess, except for in this picture.
and when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
this is a still from a film i worked on recently, called "blind door."
i've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
and this is the first theater project i worked on.
i adapted and produced "a dream play" by august strindberg.
it was performed last september one time only in the atlantic avenue tunnel in brooklyn, which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world, built in 1844.
i've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
but whenever i get a chance i still work on my series.
the last place i visited was the mayan ruins of copan, honduras.
this was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
i like doing more than just exploring these spaces.
i feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way -- before they're lost forever.

for as far back as we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated with death and resurrection.
nearly every religion in the world has some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters, the dead keep coming back.
but is resurrection really possible?
and what is the actual difference between a living creature and a dead body, anyway?
to understand what death is, we need to understand what life is.
one ancient theory was an idea called vitalism, which claimed that living things were unique because they were filled with a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life.
whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence was common throughout the world, and still persists in the stories of creatures who can somehow drain life from others, or some form of magical sources that can replenish it.
vitalism began to fade in the western world following the scientific revolution in the 17th century.
rené descartes advanced the notion that the human body was essentially no different from any other machine, brought to life by a divinely created soul located in the brain's pineal gland.
and in 1907, dr. duncan mcdougall even claimed that the soul had mass, weighing patients immediately before and after death in an attempt to prove it.
though his experiments were discredited, much like the rest of vitalism, traces of his theory still come up in popular culture.
but where do all these discredited theories leave us?
what we now know is that life is not contained in some magical substance or spark, but within the ongoing biological processes themselves.
and to understand these processes, we need to zoom down to the level of our individual cells.
inside each of these cells, chemical reactions are constantly occurring, powered by the glucose and oxygen that our bodies convert into the energy - carrying molecule known as atp.
cells use this energy for everything from repair to growth to reproduction.
not only does it take a lot of energy to make the necessary molecules, but it takes even more to get them where they need to be.
the universal phenomenon of entropy means that molecules will tend towards diffusing randomly, moving from areas of high concentration to low concentration, or even breaking apart into smaller molecules and atoms.
so cells must constantly keep entropy in check by using energy to maintain their molecules in the very complicated formations necessary for biological functions to occur.
the breaking down of these arrangements when the entire cell succumbs to entropy is what eventually results in death.
we can pump air into someone's lungs, but it wo n't do much good if the many other processes involved in the respiratory cycle are no longer functioning.
similarly, the electric shock from a defibrillator does n't jump - start an inanimate heart, but resynchronizes the muscle cells in an abnormally beating heart so they regain their normal rhythm.
this can prevent a person from dying, but it wo n't raise a dead body, or a monster sewn together from dead bodies.
so it would seem that all our various medical miracles can delay or prevent death but not reverse it.
but that's not as simple as it sounds because constant advancements in technology and medicine have resulted in diagnoses such as coma, describing potentially reversible conditions, under which people would have previously been considered dead.
some animals are known to extend their lifespans or survive extreme conditions by slowing down their biological processes to the point where they are virtually paused.
and research into cryonics hopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people and reviving them later when newer technology is able to help them.
see, if the cells are frozen, there's very little molecular movement, and diffusion practically stops.
even if all of a person's cellular processes had already broken down, this could still conceivably be reversed by a swarm of nanobots, moving all the molecules back to their proper positions, and injecting all of the cells with atp at the same time, presumably causing the body to simply pick up where it left off.
so if we think of life not as some magical spark, but a state of incredibly complex, self - perpetuating organization, death is just the process of increasing entropy that destroys this fragile balance.
and the point at which someone is completely dead turns out not to be a fixed constant, but simply a matter of how much of this entropy we're currently capable of reversing.

"do n't talk to strangers."
you have heard that phrase uttered by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.
it's a norm.
but it's a special kind of social norm, because it's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we should n't relate to.
"do n't talk to strangers" says, "stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.
stick with the people you know.
stick with people like you.
how appealing is that?
it's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?
when we're at our best, we reach out to people who are not like us, because when we do that, we learn from people who are not like us.
my phrase for this value of being with "not like us" is "strangeness," and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world, strangers are quite frankly not the point.
the point that we should be worried about is, how much strangeness are we getting?
because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data, and data turns our social relations into digital relations, and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness, a sense of discovery, a sense of surprise and unpredictability.
why not strangers?
because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries.
they belong to a world of people i know versus people i do n't know, and in the context of my digital relations, i'm already doing things with people i do n't know.
the question is n't whether or not i know you.
the question is, what can i do with you?
what can i learn with you?
what can we do together that benefits us both?
i spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing, how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people.
the most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future.
the economies of the future depend on that.
our social lives in the future depend on that.
the threat to worry about is n't strangers.
the threat to worry about is whether or not we're getting our fair share of strangeness.
now, 20th - century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers, but they were n't thinking so dynamically about human relations, and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices.
stanley milgram from the '60s and' 70s, the creator of the small - world experiments, which became later popularized as six degrees of separation, made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.
his point was that strangers are out there.
we can reach them.
there are paths that enable us to reach them.
mark granovetter, stanford sociologist, in 1973 in his seminal essay "the strength of weak ties," made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks, these strangers, are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties, the people closest to us.
he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us, these strong ties in our lives, actually have a homogenizing effect on us.
they produce sameness.
my colleagues and i at intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives, what kinds of new routines are possible.
we've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions, those things that used to be very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses, and to make them available to people we do n't know.
whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars, whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music, we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we've never met.
and we concluded a very important insight, which was that as people's relationships to the things in their lives change, so do their relations with other people.
and yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat.
it continues to try to predict what i need based on some past characterization of who i am, of what i've already done.
security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks, keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.
categories like "friends" and "family" and "contacts" and "colleagues" do n't tell me anything about my actual relations.
a more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance, where at any given point in time, with any single person, i am both close and distant from that individual, all as a function of what i need to do right now.
people are n't close or distant.
people are always a combination of the two, and that combination is constantly changing.
what if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?
what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that i need right now?
strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now, that enables me to find the sources of intimacy, of discovery, and of inspiration that i need right now.
strangeness is not about meeting strangers.
it simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity.
so jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness, and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today, but also by organizations, organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.
whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not, whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few, whether you're a teenager in her bedroom who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents, strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations.
we have to change the norms.
we have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses.
what interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers?
how might we think differently about our relations with people?
how might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people?
how might we think differently about our relations with technologies, things that effectively become social participants in their own right?
the range of digital relations is extraordinary.
in the context of this broad range of digital relations, safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation.
cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over 50 years last october.
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get.
and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most.
we've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage, but we still ca n't do that with water, and here's why.
right now, if you want to test water in the field, you need a trained technician, expensive equipment like this, and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.
it's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change, too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing.
and it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile, people still need to drink water.
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak did n't come from testing water; it came from forms like this, which documented all the people we failed to help.
countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines -- a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they're safe.
i've been inspired by that simplicity as i've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people i've ever known.
we think there's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday.
it's in its early stages, but this is what it looks like right now.
we call it the water canary.
it's a fast, cheap device that answers an important question: is this water contaminated?
it does n't require any special training.
and instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, it uses light.
that means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information.
to test water, you simply insert a sample and, within seconds, it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water, or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.
this will make it possible for anyone to collect life - saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.
we're also, on top of that, integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with gps and gsm.
what that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time.
with enough users, maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action, containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from.
and then, instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most, it can happen automatically.
we've seen how distributed networks, big data and information can transform society.
i think it's time for us to apply them to water.
our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field and to open - source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation, so we can tackle this problem together.
thank you.
we are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the 20th century, because during that century, our minds have altered dramatically.
as you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology.
and our minds have altered, too.
we've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world, and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits, new habits of mind.
and these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification, introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent, and also taking the hypothetical seriously, that is, wondering about what might have been rather than what is.
now, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive i.q. gains over time, and these have been truly massive.
that is, we do n't just get a few more questions right on i.q. tests.
we get far more questions right on i.q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented.
indeed, if you score the people a century ago against modern norms, they would have an average i.q. of 70.
if you score us against their norms, we would have an average i.q. of 130.
now this has raised all sorts of questions.
were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation?
because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.
or are we on the verge of all being gifted?
because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.
now i'm going to try and argue for a third alternative that's much more illuminating than either of those, and to put this into perspective, let's imagine that a martian came down to earth and found a ruined civilization.
and this martian was an archaeologist, and they found scores, target scores, that people had used for shooting.
and first they looked at 1865, and they found that in a minute, people had only put one bullet in the bullseye.
and then they found, in 1898, that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.
and then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.
and initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.
they would say, look, these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand, how keen their eyesight was, whether they had control of their weapon.
how could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree?
well we now know, of course, the answer.
if that martian looked at battlefields, they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the civil war and that they had repeating rifles at the time of the spanish - american war, and then they had machine guns by the time of world war i.
and, in other words, it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand.
now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years, and i think again that another thinker will help us here, and that's luria.
luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age, and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world.
they wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use.
he found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical, to speculating about what might be, and he found finally that they did n't deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.
now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.
he talked to the head man of a person in rural russia.
they'd only had, as people had in 1900, about four years of schooling.
and he asked that particular person, what do crows and fish have in common?
you know, i can eat a fish.
i ca n't eat a crow.
a crow can peck at a fish.
a fish ca n't do anything to a crow.
and luria said, "but are n't they both animals?"
and he said, of course not.
one's a fish.
the other is a bird.
and he was interested, effectively, in what he could do with those concrete objects.
and then luria went to another person, and he said to them, "there are no camels in germany.
hamburg is a city in germany.
are there camels in hamburg?
and the fellow said, "well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."
and luria said, "but what do my words imply?"
and he said, "well, maybe it's a small village, and there's no room for camels."
in other words, he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem, and he was used to camels being in villages, and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical, to ask himself what if there were no camels in germany.
a third interview was conducted with someone about the north pole.
and luria said, "at the north pole, there is always snow.
wherever there is always snow, the bears are white.
what color are the bears at the north pole?
and the response was, "such a thing is to be settled by testimony.
if a wise person came from the north pole and told me the bears were white, i might believe him, but every bear that i have seen is a brown bear.
now you see again, this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience, and it was important to that person what color bears were -- that is, they had to hunt bears.
they were n't willing to engage in this.
one of them said to luria, "how can we solve things that are n't real problems?
none of these problems are real.
how can we address them?
now, these three categories -- classification, using logic on abstractions, taking the hypothetical seriously -- how much difference do they make in the real world beyond the testing room?
and let me give you a few illustrations.
first, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.
that is, we've gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of formal education, and 52 percent of americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.
now, not only do we have much more education, and much of that education is scientific, and you ca n't do science without classifying the world.
you ca n't do science without proposing hypotheses.
you ca n't do science without making it logically consistent.
and even down in grade school, things have changed.
in 1910, they looked at the examinations that the state of ohio gave to 14 - year - olds, and they found that they were all for socially valued concrete information.
they were things like, what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time?
when they looked at the exams that the state of ohio gave in 1990, they were all about abstractions.
they were things like, why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?
and you were supposed to think, well, the state legislature was rural - controlled, and they hated the big city, so rather than putting the capital in a big city, they put it in a county seat.
they put it in albany rather than new york.
they put it in harrisburg rather than philadelphia.
and so forth.
so the tenor of education has changed.
we are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously, to use abstractions, and to link them logically.
what about employment?
well, in 1900, three percent of americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.
only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.
today, 35 percent of americans practice cognitively demanding professions, not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer, but many, many sub-professions having to do with being a technician, a computer programmer.
a whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.
and we can only meet the terms of employment in the modern world by being cognitively far more flexible.
and it's not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions.
the professions have been upgraded.
compare the doctor in 1900, who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve, with the modern general practitioner or specialist, with years of scientific training.
compare the banker in 1900, who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage.
well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss, but they were cognitively very agile.
they went far beyond that 1900 banker.
they had to look at computer projections for the housing market.
they had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a aaa, though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.
and they also, of course, had to get people to accept these so - called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable.
or take a farmer today.
i take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of 1900.
so it has n't just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions.
it's also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties.
but i've talked about education and employment.
some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the 20th century have paid off in unexpected areas.
i'm primarily a moral philosopher.
i merely have a holiday in psychology, and what interests me in general is moral debate.
now over the last century, in developed nations like america, moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously, and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections.
my father was born in 1885, and he was mildly racially biased.
as an irishman, he hated the english so much, he did n't have much emotion for anyone else.
(laughter) but he did have a sense that black people were inferior.
they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.
who have you ever known who woke up in the morning -- (laughter) -- that turned black?
in other words, they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited.
they would not take the hypothetical seriously, and without the hypothetical, it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.
you have to say, imagine you were in iran, and imagine that your relatives all suffered from collateral damage even though they had done no wrong.
how would you feel about that?
and if someone of the older generation says, well, our government takes care of us, and it's up to their government to take care of them, they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.
or take an islamic father whose daughter has been raped, and he feels he's honor - bound to kill her.
well, he's treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited, and they're unmovable in any way by logic.
they're just inherited mores.
today we would say something like, well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.
would you deserve to be killed?
and he would say, well that's not in the koran.
that's not one of the principles i've got.
well you, today, universalize your principles.
you state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.
if you have a principle such as, people should n't suffer unless they're guilty of something, then to exclude black people you've got to make exceptions, do n't you?
you have to say, well, blackness of skin, you could n't suffer just for that.
and then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, ca n't we, and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted when st. augustine was black and thomas sowell is black.
and you can get moral argument off the ground, then, because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.
you're treating them as universals, to be rendered consistent by logic.
now how did all of this arise out of i.q. tests?
that's what initially got me going on cognitive history.
if you look at the i.q. test, you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.
the similarities subtest of the wechsler is about classification, and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest.
there are other parts of the i.q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions.
some of you may have taken raven's progressive matrices, and it's all about analogies.
and in 1900, people could do simple analogies.
that is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.
what are dogs like?
they would say wolves.
but by 1960, people could attack raven's on a much more sophisticated level.
if you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle, what follows two circles?
they could say a semicircle.
just as a triangle is half of a square, a semicircle is half of a circle.
by 2010, college graduates, if you said two circles followed by a semicircle, two sixteens followed by what, they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.
that is, they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.
now, i should say one thing that's very disheartening.
we have n't made progress on all fronts.
one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics, and sadly you can have humane moral principles, you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions, and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries, you ca n't do politics.
we've noticed, in a trend among young americans, that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands, and they're essentially ahistorical.
they do n't know the korean war from the war in vietnam.
they do n't know who was an ally of america in world war ii.
think how different america would be if every american knew that this is the fifth time western armies have gone to afghanistan to put its house in order, and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions.
(laughter) and that is, they had barely left, and there was n't a trace in the sand.
or imagine how different things would be if most americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars.
you know, the spanish did n't sink the battleship maine, the lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions, the north vietnamese did not attack the seventh fleet, and, of course, saddam hussein hated al qaeda and had nothing to do with it, and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms, when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.
but i do n't want to end on a pessimistic note.
the 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary people that we have now realized, and the aristocracy was convinced that the average person could n't make it, that they could never share their mindset or their cognitive abilities.
lord curzon once said he saw people bathing in the north sea, and he said, "why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have?"
as if they were a reptile.
well, dickens was right and he was wrong.
kipling said, "the colonel's lady and judy o'grady are sisters underneath the skin."
so, imagine that you had your smartphone miniaturized and hooked up directly to your brain.
if you had this sort of brain chip, you'd be able to upload and download to the internet at the speed of thought.
accessing social media or wikipedia would be a lot like -- well, from the inside at least -- like consulting your own memory.
it would be as easy and as intimate as thinking.
but would it make it easier for you to know what's true?
just because a way of accessing information is faster it does n't mean it's more reliable, of course, and it does n't mean that we would all interpret it the same way.
and it does n't mean that you would be any better at evaluating it.
in fact, you might even be worse, because, you know, more data, less time for evaluation.
something like this is already happening to us right now.
we already carry a world of information around in our pockets, but it seems as if the more information we share and access online, the more difficult it can be for us to tell the difference between what's real and what's fake.
it's as if we know more but understand less.
now, it's a feature of modern life, i suppose, that large swaths of the public live in isolated information bubbles.
we're polarized: not just over values, but over the facts.
one reason for that is, the data analytics that drive the internet get us not just more information, but more of the information that we want.
our online life is personalized; everything from the ads we read to the news that comes down our facebook feed is tailored to satisfy our preferences.
and so while we get more information, a lot of that information ends up reflecting ourselves as much as it does reality.
it ends up, i suppose, inflating our bubbles rather than bursting them.
and so maybe it's no surprise that we're in a situation, a paradoxical situation, of thinking that we know so much more, and yet not agreeing on what it is we know.
so how are we going to solve this problem of knowledge polarization?
one obvious tactic is to try to fix our technology, to redesign our digital platforms, so as to make them less susceptible to polarization.
and i'm happy to report that many smart people at google and facebook are working on just that.
and these projects are vital.
i think that fixing technology is obviously really important, but i do n't think technology alone, fixing it, is going to solve the problem of knowledge polarization.
i do n't think that because i do n't think, at the end of the day, it is a technological problem.
i think it's a human problem, having to do with how we think and what we value.
in order to solve it, i think we're going to need help.
we're going to need help from psychology and political science.
because to solve the problem of knowledge polarization, we're going to need to reconnect with one fundamental, philosophical idea: that we live in a common reality.
the idea of a common reality is like, i suppose, a lot of philosophical concepts: easy to state but mysteriously difficult to put into practice.
to really accept it, i think we need to do three things, each of which is a challenge right now.
first, we need to believe in truth.
you might have noticed that our culture is having something of a troubled relationship with that concept right now.
it seems as if we disagree so much that, as one political commentator put it not long ago, it's as if there are no facts anymore.
but that thought is actually an expression of a sort of seductive line of argument that's in the air.
it goes like this: we just ca n't step outside of our own perspectives; we ca n't step outside of our biases.
every time we try, we just get more information from our perspective.
so, this line of thought goes, we might as well admit that objective truth is an illusion, or it does n't matter, because either we'll never know what it is, or it does n't exist in the first place.
that's not a new philosophical thought -- skepticism about truth.
during the end of the last century, as some of you know, it was very popular in certain academic circles.
but it really goes back all the way to the greek philosopher protagoras, if not farther back.
protagoras said that objective truth was an illusion because "man is the measure of all things."
man is the measure of all things.
that can seem like a bracing bit of realpolitik to people, or liberating, because it allows each of us to discover or make our own truth.
but actually, i think it's a bit of self - serving rationalization disguised as philosophy.
it confuses the difficulty of being certain with the impossibility of truth.
look -- of course it's difficult to be certain about anything; we might all be living in "the matrix."
you might have a brain chip in your head feeding you all the wrong information.
but in practice, we do agree on all sorts of facts.
we agree that bullets can kill people.
we agree that you ca n't flap your arms and fly.
we agree -- or we should -- that there is an external reality and ignoring it can get you hurt.
nonetheless, skepticism about truth can be tempting, because it allows us to rationalize away our own biases.
when we do that, we're sort of like the guy in the movie who knew he was living in "the matrix" but decided he liked it there, anyway.
after all, getting what you want feels good.
being right all the time feels good.
so, often it's easier for us to wrap ourselves in our cozy information bubbles, live in bad faith, and take those bubbles as the measure of reality.
an example, i think, of how this bad faith gets into our action is our reaction to the phenomenon of fake news.
the fake news that spread on the internet during the american presidential election of 2016 was designed to feed into our biases, designed to inflate our bubbles.
but what was really striking about it was not just that it fooled so many people.
what was really striking to me about fake news, the phenomenon, is how quickly it itself became the subject of knowledge polarization; so much so, that the very term -- the very term -- "fake news" now just means: "news story i do n't like."
that's an example of the bad faith towards the truth that i'm talking about.
but the really, i think, dangerous thing about skepticism with regard to truth is that it leads to despotism.
"man is the measure of all things" inevitably becomes "the man is the measure of all things."
just as "every man for himself" always seems to turn out to be "only the strong survive."
at the end of orwell's "1984," the thought policeman o'brien is torturing the protagonist winston smith into believing two plus two equals five.
what o'brien says is the point, is that he wants to convince smith that whatever the party says is the truth, and the truth is whatever the party says.
and what o'brien knows is that once this thought is accepted, critical dissent is impossible.
you ca n't speak truth to power if the power speaks truth by definition.
i said that in order to accept that we really live in a common reality, we have to do three things.
the first thing is to believe in truth.
the second thing can be summed up by the latin phrase that kant took as the motto for the enlightenment: "sapere aude," or "dare to know."
or as kant wants, "to dare to know for yourself."
i think in the early days of the internet, a lot of us thought that information technology was always going to make it easier for us to know for ourselves, and of course in many ways, it has.
but as the internet has become more and more a part of our lives, our reliance on it, our use of it, has become often more passive.
much of what we know today we google - know.
we download prepackaged sets of facts and sort of shuffle them along the assembly line of social media.
now, google - knowing is useful precisely because it involves a sort of intellectual outsourcing.
we offload our effort onto a network of others and algorithms.
and that allows us, of course, to not clutter our minds with all sorts of facts.
we can just download them when we need them.
and that's awesome .1111111
but there's a difference between downloading a set of facts and really understanding how or why those facts are as they are.
understanding why a particular disease spreads, or how a mathematical proof works, or why your friend is depressed, involves more than just downloading.
it's going to require, most likely, doing some work for yourself: having a little creative insight; using your imagination; getting out into the field; doing the experiment; working through the proof; talking to someone.
now, i'm not saying, of course, that we should stop google - knowing.
i'm just saying we should n't overvalue it, either.
we need to find ways of encouraging forms of knowing that are more active, and do n't always involve passing off our effort into our bubble.
because the thing about google - knowing is that too often it ends up being bubble - knowing.
and bubble - knowing means always being right.
but daring to know, daring to understand, means risking the possibility that you could be wrong.
it means risking the possibility that what you want and what's true are different things.
which brings me to the third thing that i think we need to do if we want to accept that we live in a common reality.
that third thing is: have a little humility.
by humility here, i mean epistemic humility, which means, in a sense, knowing that you do n't know it all.
but it also means something more than that.
it means seeing your worldview as open to improvement by the evidence and experience of others.
seeing your worldview as open to improvement by the evidence and experience of others.
it's more than just being open to self - improvement.
it means seeing your knowledge as capable of enhancing or being enriched by what others contribute.
that's part of what is involved in recognizing there's a common reality that you, too, are responsible to.
i do n't think it's much of a stretch to say that our society is not particularly great at enhancing or encouraging that sort of humility.
that's partly because, well, we tend to confuse arrogance and confidence.
and it's partly because, well, you know, arrogance is just easier.
it's just easier to think of yourself as knowing it all.
it's just easier to think of yourself as having it all figured out.
but that's another example of the bad faith towards the truth that i've been talking about.
so the concept of a common reality, like a lot of philosophical concepts, can seem so obvious, that we can look right past it and forget why it's important.
democracies ca n't function if their citizens do n't strive, at least some of the time, to inhabit a common space, a space where they can pass ideas back and forth when -- and especially when -- they disagree.
but you ca n't strive to inhabit that space if you do n't already accept that you live in the same reality.
to accept that, we've got to believe in truth, we've got to encourage more active ways of knowing.
and we've got to have the humility to realize that we're not the measure of all things.
we may yet one day realize the vision of having the internet in our brains.
but if we want that to be liberating and not terrifying, if we want it to expand our understanding and not just our passive knowing, we need to remember that our perspectives, as wondrous, as beautiful as they are, are just that -- perspectives on one reality.
i would like to tell you about a project which i started about 16 years ago.
it's about making new forms of life.
and these are made of this kind of tube -- electricity tube, we call it in holland.
and we can start a film about that, and we can see a little bit backwards in time.
narrator: eventually, these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches.
theo jansen is working hard on this evolution.
theo jansen: i want to put these forms of life on the beaches.
and they should survive over there, on their own, in the future.
learning to live on their own -- and it'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own.
narrator: the mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food, but from the wind.
the wind will move feathers on their back, which will drive their feet.
the beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach, with it s nose pointed into the wind.
as soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand, it stops, and walks in the opposite direction.
evolution has generated many species.
this is a herd, and it is built according to genetic codes.
and it is a sort of race, and each and every animal is different, and the winning codes will multiply.
this is the wave, going from left to right. you can see this one.
yes, and now it goes from left to right.
this is a new generation, a new family, which is able to store the wind.
so, the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles, which are on top of that.
and they can use that energy in case the wind falls away, and the tide is coming up, and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives, because they are drowned very easily.
(laughter) i could show you this animal.
so, the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking.
there are 11 numbers, which i call the 11 holy numbers.
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way.
in fact, it's a new invention of the wheel.
it works the same as a wheel.
the axis of a wheel stays on the same level, and this hip is staying on the same level as well.
in fact, this is better than a wheel, because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach, you will notice it's very hard to do.
and the feet just step over the sand, and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in - between.
so 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel, we have a new wheel.
i will show you, in the next video -- can you start it, please? -- that very heavy loads can be moved.
there's a guy pushing there, behind, but it can also walk on the wind very well.
it's 3.2 tons.
this is working on the stored wind in the bottles.
it has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around.
you see, it's going the other way.
can i have the feeler here?
so, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach, and one of the big dangers is the sea.
this is the sea.
and it must feel the water of the sea.
and this is the water feeler, and what's very important is this tube.
it sucks in air normally, but when it swallows water, it feels the resistance of it.
so, imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea.
as soon as it touches the water, you should hear a sound of running air.
so if it does n't feel, it will be drowned, ok?
here we have the brain of the animal.
in fact, it is a step counter, and it counts the steps.
it's a binary step counter.
so as soon it has been to the sea, it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here.
and it always knows where it is on the beach.
so it's very simple brain.
it says, well, there's the sea, there are dunes, and i'm here.
so it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal.
thank you.
one of the biggest enemies are the storms.
this is a part of the nose of the animaris percipiere.
when the nose of the animal is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
so when the storm is coming up, it drives a pin into the ground.
the nose is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
the wind may turn, but the animal will always turn it s nose into the wind.
now, another couple of years, and these animals will survive on their own.
i still have to help them a lot.
i'm a physician trained in infectious diseases, and following my training, i moved to somalia from san francisco.
and my goodbye greeting from the chief of infectious diseases at san francisco general was, "gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."
but i landed in a refugee situation that had a million refugees in 40 camps, and there were six of us doctors.
there were many epidemics there.
my responsibilities were largely related to tuberculosis, and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.
so it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that i was responsible for inhibiting.
and in order to do this work, we, of course, because of the limitation in health workers, had to recruit refugees to be a specialized new category of health worker.
following three years of work in somalia, i got picked up by the world health organization, and got assigned to the epidemics of aids.
my primary responsibility was uganda, but also i worked in rwanda and burundi and zaire, now congo, tanzania, malawi, and several other countries.
and my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development, which was responsible for designing interventions.
after 10 years of working overseas, i was exhausted.
i really had very little left.
i had been traveling to one country after another.
i was emotionally feeling very isolated.
i wanted to come home.
i'd seen a lot of death, in particular epidemic death, and epidemic death has a different feel to it.
it's full of panic and fear, and i'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert.
and i wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over.
i was not aware of any epidemic problems in america.
in fact, i was n't aware of any problems in america.
in fact -- seriously.
and in fact i would visit friends of mine, and i noticed that they had water that came right into their homes.
how many of you have such a situation?
(laughter) and some of them, many of them actually, had water that came into more than one room.
and i noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree or two degrees.
and now i do that.
and i really did n't know what i would do, but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns.
and i asked the question, what are you doing about it?
what are you in america doing about it?
and there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent.
and one was punishment.
and this i had heard about before.
we who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued.
it was not a main driver of behavior, nor was it a main driver of behavior change.
and besides that, it reminded me of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science had n't been there before, epidemics of plague or typhus or leprosy, where the prevalent ideas were that there were bad people or bad humors or bad air, and widows were dragged around the moat, and dungeons were part of the solution.
the other explanation or, in a way, the solution suggested, is please fix all of these things: the schools, the community, the homes, the families, everything.
and i'd heard this before as well.
i'd called this the "everything" theory, or eoe: everything on earth.
but we'd also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you do n't need to treat everything.
and so the sense that i had was there was a giant gap here.
the problem of violence was stuck, and this has historically been the case in many other issues.
diarrheal diseases had been stuck.
malaria had been stuck.
frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.
it's not as if i had any idea what it would look like, but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education.
but i began to ask questions and search out the usual things that i had been exploring before, like, what do the maps look like?
what do the graphs look like?
and the maps of violence in most u.s. cities looked like this.
there was clustering.
this reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also in infectious epidemics, for example cholera.
and then we looked at the maps, and the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave, because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics.
and it also looked like infectious epidemics.
and then we asked the question, well what really predicts a case of violence?
and it turns out that the greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.
which also sounds like, if there is a case of flu, someone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold, or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis.
and so we see that violence is, in a way, behaving like a contagious disease.
we're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence from fights or in gang wars or in civil wars or even in genocides.
and so there's good news about this, though, because there's a way to reverse epidemics, and there's really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics, and the first of it is interrupting transmission.
in order to interrupt transmission, you need to detect and find first cases.
in other words, for t.b. you have to find somebody who has active t.b. who is infecting other people.
make sense?
and there's special workers for doing that.
for this particular problem, we designed a new category of worker who, like a sars worker or someone looking for bird flu, might find first cases.
in this case, it's someone who's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money, and you can find workers and train them into these specialized categories.
and the second thing to do, of course, is to prevent further spread, that means to find who else has been exposed, but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of t.b., or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods, but in the same group, and then they need to be, in a way, managed as well, particular to the specific disease process.
and then the third part, the shifting the norms, and that means a whole bunch of community activities, remodeling, public education, and then you've got what you might call group immunity.
and that combination of factors is how the aids epidemic in uganda was very successfully reversed.
and so what we decided to do in the year 2000 is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers, the first being violence interruptors.
and then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the united states at the time.
so violence interruptors hired from the same group, credibility, trust, access, just like the health workers in somalia, but designed for a different category, and trained in persuasion, cooling people down, buying time, reframing.
and then another category of worker, the outreach workers, to keep people in a way on therapy for six to 24 months.
just like t.b., but the object is behavior change.
and then a bunch of community activities for changing norms.
now our first experiment of this resulted in a 67 - percent drop in shootings and killings in the west garfield neighborhood of chicago.
(applause) and this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself, first 50 or 60 days, then 90 days, and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another 90 days, and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.
they were using parks they were n't using before.
everybody was happy.
but of course, the funders said, "wait a second, do it again."
and so we had to then, fortunately, get the funds to repeat this experience, and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a 45 - percent drop in shootings and killings.
and since that time, this has been replicated 20 times.
there have been independent evaluations supported by the justice department and by the cdc and performed by johns hopkins that have shown 30 - to - 50 - percent and 40 - to - 70 - percent reductions in shootings and killings using this new method.
in fact, there have been three independent evaluations of this now.
now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this, including being featured on the new york times' sunday magazine cover story.
the economist in 2009 said this is "the approach that will come to prominence."
and even a movie was made around our work.
[the interrupters] however, not so fast, because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it.
we got a lot of criticism, a lot of opposition, and a lot of opponents.
in other words, what do you mean, health problem?
what do you mean, epidemic?
what do you mean, no bad guys?
and there's whole industries designed for managing bad people.
what do you mean, hiring people who have backgrounds?
my business friends said, "gary, you're being criticized tremendously.
you must be doing something right. "
(laughter) my musician friends added the word "dude."
so anyway, additionally, there was still this problem, and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems.
yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce hiv and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy.
so what's actually happened is, although there is still some opposition, the movement is clearly growing.
many of the major cities in the u.s., including new york city and baltimore and kansas city, their health departments are running this now.
chicago and new orleans, the health departments are having a very large role in this.
this is being embraced more by law enforcement than it had been years ago.
trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up.
and the u.s. conference of mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model.
where there's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment, where there's a 55 - percent drop in the first neighborhood in puerto rico, where interruptions are just beginning in honduras, where the strategy has been applied in kenya for the recent elections, and where there have been 500 interruptions in iraq.
so violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease.
so the theory, in a way, is kind of being validated by the treatment.
and recently, the institute of medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data, including the neuroscience, on how this problem is really transmitted.
so i think this is good news, because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the middle ages, which is where i feel this field has been.
it gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks, and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods, and to allow there to be a new strategy, a new set of methods, a new set of workers: science, in a way, replacing morality.
and moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to science as a more important part of the solution.
so i did n't mean to come up with this at all.
it was a matter of, i wanted actually a break, and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs, we asked some questions and tried some tools that actually have been used many times before for other things.
for myself, i tried to get away from infectious diseases, and i did n't.
for more than 100 years, the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments.
for much of this time, this assistance was manual.
surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand.
calls were recorded to tape.
but as in so many other industries, computing has changed everything.
the telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks.
i want that to sink in for a second: our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first.
first and foremost.
so what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse, your children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone, someone could be listening.
now, that someone might be your own government; it could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service, or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system, that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies.
but while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority, silicon valley companies have not.
and increasingly, over the last couple years, silicon valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult.
for example, many of you might have an iphone, and if you use an iphone to send a text message to other people who have an iphone, those text messages can not easily be wiretapped.
and in fact, according to apple, they're not able to even see the text messages themselves.
likewise, if you use facetime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones, that, too, can not be easily wiretapped.
what sapp, which is now owned by facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, also has built strong encryption technology into its product, which means that people in the global south can easily communicate without their governments, often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages.
so, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call, anytime, anywhere, you might imagine that government officials are not very happy.
and in fact, that's what's happening.
government officials are extremely mad.
and they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available.
what upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default.
it's the default piece that matters.
in short, the tech companies have democratized encryption.
and so, government officials like british prime minister david cameron, they believe that all communications -- emails, texts, voice calls -- all of these should be available to governments, and encryption is making that difficult.
we live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world, and there really are bad people out there.
there are terrorists and other serious national security threats that i suspect we all want the fbi and the nsa to monitor.
but those surveillance features come at a cost.
the reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop, or a drug dealer's cell phone.
we all use the same communications devices.
what that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted, then so can the rest of ours, too.
and i think we really need to ask: should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly?
so the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that i've described -- this is not imaginary.
in 2009, the surveillance systems that google and microsoft built into their networks -- the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police -- those systems were compromised by the chinese government, because the chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the us government was monitoring.
by the same token, in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network of vodafone greece -- greece's largest telephone company -- was compromised by an unknown entity, and that feature, the surveillance feature, was used to wiretap the greek prime minister and members of the greek cabinet.
the foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught.
and really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors.
when you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it.
you have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys.
and so for that reason, i think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible.
yes, this means that in the future, encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult.
it means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys.
but the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies.
and i do n't want to live in that kind of world.
and so right now, you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets, you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are, or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are.
and so, my message to you is this: we need to use these tools.
we need to secure our telephone calls.
we need to secure our text messages.
i want you to use these tools.
i want you to tell your loved ones, i want you to tell your colleagues: use these encrypted communications tools.
do n't just use them because they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure.
imagine that you are a product designer.
and you've designed a product, a new type of product, called the human immune system.
you're pitching this product to a skeptical, strictly no - nonsense manager.
let's call him bob.
i think we all know at least one bob, right?
how would that go?
bob, i've got this incredible idea for a completely new type of personal health product.
it's called the human immune system.
i can see from your face that you're having some problems with this.
do n't worry.
i know it's very complicated.
i do n't want to take you through the gory details, i just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product.
first of all, it cleverly uses redundancy by having millions of copies of each component -- leukocytes, white blood cells -- before they're actually needed, to create a massive buffer against the unexpected.
and it cleverly leverages diversity by having not just leukocytes but b cells, t cells, natural killer cells, antibodies.
the components do n't really matter.
the point is that together, this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up.
and the design is completely modular.
you have the surface barrier of the human skin, you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system.
the point is, that if one system fails, another can take over, creating a virtually foolproof system.
i can see i'm losing you, bob, but stay with me, because here is the really killer feature.
the product is completely adaptive.
it's able to actually develop targeted antibodies to threats that it's never even met before.
it actually also does this with incredible prudence, detecting and reacting to every tiny threat, and furthermore, remembering every previous threat, in case they are ever encountered again.
what i'm pitching you today is actually not a stand - alone product.
the product is embedded in the larger system of the human body, and it works in complete harmony with that system, to create this unprecedented level of biological protection.
so bob, just tell me honestly, what do you think of my product?
and bob may say something like, i sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone into your presentation, blah blah blah -- (laughter) but honestly, it's total nonsense.
you seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product are that it is inefficient and complex.
did n't they teach you 80 - 20?
and furthermore, you're saying that this product is siloed.
it overreacts, makes things up as it goes along and is actually designed for somebody else's benefit.
i'm sorry to break it to you, but i do n't think this one is a winner.
and efficiency is always important in the short term.
less complex, more efficient, more bang for the buck.
who could say no to that?
unfortunately, there's one very tiny problem, and that is that the user of this product, you or i, would probably die within one week of the next winter, when we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus.
i first became interested in biology and business, and longevity and resilience, when i was asked a very unusual question by the ceo of a global tech company.
and the question was: what do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years?
a seemingly innocent question, but actually, it's a little trickier than you might think, considering that the average us public company now can expect a life span of only 30 years.
that is less than half of the life span that it s employees can expect to enjoy.
now, if you were the ceo of such a company, badgered by investors and buffeted by change, we might forgive you for not even worrying too much about what happens 30 years out.
but here's something that should keep you awake at night: the probability that your company will not be around in five year's time, on average, is now a staggering 32 percent.
that's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over or will fail within just five years.
let's come back to our tech ceo's question.
where better to turn for advice than nature, that's been in the business of life and death for longer than any company?
as a lapsed biologist, i decided to immediately call a real biologist, my friend simon levin, professor of biology and mathematics at princeton university.
together, we looked at a variety of biological systems, ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries.
and we asked ourselves the question: what makes these systems resilient and enduring?
and what we found was that the same six principles that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system actually cropped up again and again, from redundancy through to embeddedness.
in fact, we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems, we also found them being very characteristic of long - lived social systems, like the roman empire and the catholic church, believe it or not.
we also went on to look at business, and found that these very same properties also characterized businesses that were resilient and long - lived, and we noted their absence from ones which were short - lived.
let's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system collapses.
this beautiful building is part of the shitennoji temple complex in osaka, japan.
in fact, it's one of the oldest temples in japan.
it was built by a korean artisan, because at the time, japan was not yet building temples.
and this korean artisan went on to found a temple - building company.
amazingly, his company, kongō gumi, was still around 1,428 years later.
in fact, it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world.
so how is kongō gumi doing today?
not too well, i'm afraid.
it borrowed very heavily during the bubble period of the japanese economy, to invest in real estate.
and when the bubble burst, it could n't refinance its loans.
the company failed, and it was taken over by a major construction company.
tragically, after 40 generations of very careful stewardship by the kongō family, kongō gumi succumbed to a spectacular lapse in the ability to apply a principle of prudence.
speaking of company failures: we're all familiar with the failure of kodak, the company that declared bankruptcy in january 2012.
much more interesting, however, is the question: why did fujifilm -- same product, same pressures from digital technology, same time -- why was fujifilm able to survive and flourish?
fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry, material science and optics to diversify into a number of areas, ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals, to medical systems to biomaterials.
some of these diversification attempts failed.
but in aggregate, it was able to adapt its portfolio sufficiently to survive and flourish.
as the ceo, mr. komori, put it, the strategy succeeded because it had "more pockets and drawers" than the rivals.
he meant, of course, that they were able to create more options than the rivals.
fujifilm survived because it applied the principles of prudence, diversity and adaptation.
a catastrophic factory fire, like the one we see here, completely wiped out, in one evening, the only plant which supplied toyota with valves for car - braking systems.
the ultimate test of resilience.
car production ground to a screeching halt.
how was it, then, that toyota was able to recover car production?
can you imagine how long it took?
just five days.
from having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days.
how was this possible?
toyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative manner that it could work very quickly and smoothly with suppliers to repurpose production, fill the missing braking valve capacity and have car production come online again.
toyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network, embeddedness in an integrated system and the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose, smoothly, existing capacity.
now fortunately, few companies succumb to catastrophic fires.
but we do read in the newspaper every day about companies succumbing to the disruption of technology.
how is it, then, that the consumer optics giant essilor is able to avoid technology disruption, and even profit from it?
and yes, technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics.
essilor carefully scans the competitive environment for potentially disruptive technologies.
it acquires those technologies very early, before they've become expensive or competitors have mobilized around them, and it then develops those technologies itself, even at the risk of failure or the risk of self - disruption.
essilor stays ahead of its game, and has delivered spectacular performance for over 40 years, by using the principles of prudence and adaptation.
ok, if these principles are so powerful, you might be thinking, why are they not commonplace in business?
why do we not use these words every day?
well, change has to first start in the mind.
if we think back to our pitch to bob, in order to apply the principles that underpin the miracle of the human immune system, we first need to think differently about business.
now typically, when we think about business, we use what i call "mechanical thinking."
we set goals, we analyze problems, we construct and we adhere to plans, and more than anything else, we stress efficiency and short - term performance.
now, do n't get me wrong - this is a splendidly practical and effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments.
it's the way that bob -- and probably many of us, myself included -- process most business problems we're faced with every day.
in fact, it was a pretty good mental model for business -- overall -- until about the mid-1980s, when the conjunction of globalization and a revolution in technology and telecommunications made business far more dynamic and unpredictable.
but what about those more dynamic and unpredictable situations that we now increasingly face?
i think in addition to the mechanical thinking, we now need to master the art of biological thinking, as embodied by our six principles.
in other words, we need to think more modestly and subtly about when and how we can shape, rather than control, unpredictable and complex situations.
it's a little like the difference between throwing a ball and releasing a bird.
the ball would head in a straight line, probably towards the intended target, and the bird certainly would not.
so what do you think?
sounds a little impractical, a little theoretical, perhaps?
not at all.
every small entrepreneurial company naturally thinks and acts biologically.
because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force.
it lacks the scale to buffer change, and it's constantly thinking about the tough odds for a start - up to survive.
now, the irony is, of course, that every large company started off as a small, entrepreneurial company.
but along the way somewhere, many have lost this ability to think and act biologically.
they need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically in order to survive and thrive in today's environment.
every company i know spends plenty of time thinking about the central question of strategy: how good is our competitive game?
in addition, let's also consider the second, more biological and equally important question: how long will that game last?

over the last two decades, india has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services, as we call it, and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in india, offshoring software development and back office services, there's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to india.
when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to china, it has, you know, led to considerable angst amongst the western populations.
in fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the west.
now, the western elites, however, have said this fear is misplaced.
for example, if you have read - i suspect many of you have done so - read the book by thomas friedman called "the world is flat," he said, basically, in his book that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented.
in fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the west ahead of the developing world, with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done in the developed world, and the less sophisticated, shall we say, drudge work being done in the developing world.
now, what we were trying to understand was, is this true?
could india become a source, or a global hub, of innovation, just like it's become a global hub for back office services and software development?
and for the last four years, my coauthor phanish puranam and i spent investigating this topic.
initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know, in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the western innovative model, say, "where are the indian googles, ipods and viagras, if the indians are so bloody smart?"
(laughter) so initially, when we started our research, we went and met several executives, and we asked them, what do you think?
will india go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a destination for innovation?
they laughed.
they dismissed us.
they said, you know what?
indians do n't do innovation.
the more polite ones said, "well, you know, indians make good software programmers and accountants, but they ca n't do the creative stuff."
sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication, and people said, "you know, it's nothing to do with indians."
it's really the rule - based, regimented education system in india that is responsible for killing all creativity.
they said, instead, if you want to see real creativity, go to silicon valley, and look at companies like google, microsoft, intel.
so we started examining the rd and innovation labs of silicon valley.
well, interestingly, what you find there is, usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the rd center as they may call it, and more often than not, it's an indian.
(laughter) so i immediately said, "well, but you could not have been educated in india, right?"
you must have gotten your education here.
it turned out, in every single case, they came out of the indian educational system.
so we realized that maybe we had the wrong question, and the right question is, really, can indians based out of india do innovative work?
so off we went to india.
we made, i think, about a dozen trips to bangalore, mumbai, gurgaon, delhi, hyderabad, you name it, to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.
and what we found was, as we progressed in our research, was, that we were asking really the wrong question.
when you ask, "where are the indian googles, ipods and viagras?" you are taking a particular perspective on innovation, which is innovation for end users, visible innovation.
instead, innovation, if you remember, some of you may have read the famous economist schumpeter, he said, "innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed."
it could be new products and services, but it could also be new ways of producing products.
it could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.
once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation, the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
when you take this broader conceptualization of innovation, what we found was, india is well represented in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in india is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was we called it "invisible innovation."
and specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of india.
the first type of invisible innovation out of india is what we call innovation for business customers, which is led by the multinational corporations, which have -- in the last two decades, there have been 750 rd centers set up in india by multinational companies employing more than 400,000 professionals.
now, when you consider the fact that, historically, the rd center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin of that multinational company, to have 750 rd centers of multinational corporations in india is truly a remarkable figure.
when we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on, they said, "we are working on global products."
they were not working on localizing global products for india, which is the usual role of a local rd.
they were working on truly global products, and companies like microsoft, google, astrazeneca, general electric, philips, have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their bangalore and hyderabad rd centers they are able to produce products and services for the world.
but of course, as an end user, you do n't see that, because you only see the name of the company, not where it was developed.
the other thing we were told then was, "yes, but, you know, the kind of work that is coming out of the indian rd center can not be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the u.s. rd centers."
so my coauthor phanish puranam, who happens to be one of the smartest people i know, said he's going to do a study.
what he did was he looked at those companies that had an rd center in usa and in india, and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the u.s. and a similar patent filed out of the same company's subsidiary in india, so he's now comparing the patents of rd centers in the u.s. with rd centers in india of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the u.s. centers?
interestingly, what he finds is - and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations: how many times does a future patent reference the older patent? he finds something very interesting.
what we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a u.s. rd subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an indian subsidiary of the same company within that company.
so within the company, there's no difference in the forward citation rates of their indian subsidiaries versus their u.s. subsidiaries.
so that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of india.
the second kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call outsourcing innovation to indian companies, where many companies today are contracting indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world.
for example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules are being developed, but you see a major part of that work is being sent to india.
for example, xcl technologies, they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing 787 dreamliner, one to avoid collisions in the sky, and another to allow landing in zero visibility.
but of course, when you climb onto the boeing 787, you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of india.
the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call process innovations, because of an injection of intelligence by indian firms.
process innovation is different from product innovation.
it's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product, but not a new product itself?
only in india do millions of young people dream of working in a call center.
what happens - you know, it's a dead end job in the west, what high school dropouts do.
what happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart, young, ambitious kids on a call center job?
very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating, and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and out of this process innovation comes product innovations, which are then marketed around the world.
for example, 24 7 customer, traditional call center company, used to be a traditional call center company. today they're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone, you can guess or predict what this phone call is about.
it's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the west.
and the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call management innovation.
it's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work, and the most significant management innovation to come out of india, invented by the indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model.
what the global delivery model allows is, it allows you to take previously geographically core - located tasks, break them up into parts, send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists, and then specify the means for reintegrating them.
without that, you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today.
so, what i'm trying to say is, what we are finding in our research is, that if products for end users is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg, india is well represented in the invisible, large, submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.
now, this has, of course, some implications, and so we developed three implications of this research.
the first is what we called sinking skill ladder, and now i'm going to go back to where i started my conversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.
now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company, decide to outsource jobs to india in the rd, what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india, the least sophisticated jobs, just like tom friedman would predict.
now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india for innovation and for rd work, at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem, which is where does the next step of the ladder people come from within your company?
so you have two choices then: either you bring the people from india into the developed world to take positions in the next step of the ladder - immigration - or you say, there's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in india, why do n't we move the next step to india?
what we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you - it's a self - perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder, and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you ca n't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once.
you ca n't be a professor without having been a student.
you ca n't be a consultant without having been a research associate.
so, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs, at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.
the second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the tmt, the top management teams.
if the rd talent is going to be based out of india and china, and the largest growth markets are going to be based out of india and china, you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of india and china, because that's where the product leadership is, that's where the important market leadership is.
and the last thing we point out in this slide, which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.
india has the youngest growing population in the world.
this demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically, there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.
indian institutes and educational system, with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going, so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this, but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure.
so finally, i want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company, ibm.
as many of you know, ibm has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies.
in fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history, i think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the usa as a private company.
here is the profile of employees of ibm over the last decade.
in 2003, they had 300,000 employees, or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000 were in america, 9,000 were in india.
in 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time the u.s. employees had moved to 105,000, whereas the indian employees had gone to 100,000.
well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal this data anymore, so i had to make some estimates based on various sources.
here are my best guesses.
i'm not saying this is the exact number, it's my best guess.
it gives you a sense of the trend.
there are 433,000 people now at ibm, out of which 98,000 are remaining in the u.s., and 150,000 are in india.
so you tell me, is ibm an american company, or an indian company?
(laughter) ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissues and organs, some people initially thought we were a little crazy.
but since then, much progress has been made, both in our lab and other labs around the world.
and given this, we started getting questions like, "if you can grow human body parts, can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"
when someone first suggested this to me, quite frankly i thought they were a little crazy, but what i soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all.
what's crazy is what we do today.
i'm convinced that in 30 years, when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags, we'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy.
did you know that today we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?
and over the next few decades, as the world's population expands to 10 billion, this will need to nearly double to 100 billion animals.
but maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet.
animals are not just raw materials.
they're living beings, and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land, fresh water, and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change.
on top of this, when you get so many animals so close together, it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse.
clearly, we can not continue on this path which puts the environment, public health, and food security at risk.
there is another way, because essentially, animal products are just collections of tissues, and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues.
what if, instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal, we started with what the tissues are made of, the basic unit of life, the cell?
this is biofabrication, where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs.
already in medicine, biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts, like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone, that have been successfully implanted into patients.
and beyond medicine, biofabrication can be a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.
and we should begin by reimagining leather.
i emphasize leather because it is so widely used.
it is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.
growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat.
it mainly uses one cell type, and it is largely two - dimensional.
it is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.
until biofabrication is better understood, it is clear that, initially at least, more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods, no matter how delicious.
in this sense, leather is a gateway material, a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.
if we can succeed here, it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon.
now how do we do it?
to grow leather, we begin by taking cells from an animal, through a simple biopsy.
the animal could be a cow, lamb, or even something more exotic.
this process does no harm, and daisy the cow can live a happy life.
we then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium.
this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions.
and we then coax these cells to produce collagen, as they would naturally.
this collagen is the stuff between cells.
it's natural connective tissue.
it's the extracellular matrix, but in leather, it's the main building block.
and what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets, and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another, like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets, which we then let mature.
and finally, we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process, we create leather.
and so i'm very excited to show you, for the first time, the first batch of our cultured leather, fresh from the lab.
this is real, genuine leather, without the animal sacrifice.
it can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells, and better yet, there is no hair to remove, no scars or insect's bites, and no waste.
this leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet, a handbag or a car seat.
it is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator.
and because we make this material, we grow this leather from the ground up, we can control its properties in very interesting ways.
this piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick, and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.
and this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.
you do n't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather.
and we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities, like softness, breathability, durability, elasticity and even things like pattern.
we can mimic nature, but in some ways also improve upon it.
this type of leather can do what today's leather does, but with imagination, probably much more.
what could the future of animal products look like?
it need not look like this, which is actually the state of the art today.
rather, it could be much more like this.
already, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years, beginning with products like wine, beer and yogurt.
and speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved, and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful, sterile facilities like this.
it is where cell culture takes place.
imagine that in this facility, instead of brewing beer, we were brewing leather or meat.
imagine touring this facility, learning about how the leather or meat is cultured, seeing the process from beginning to end, and even trying some.
it's clean, open and educational, and this is in contrast to the hidden, guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today.
perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.
it's environmentally responsible, efficient and humane.
it allows us to be creative.
we can design new materials, new products, and new facilities.
we need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved.
perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured.
tales from briarcliff by lana winters, read by the author.
behind the stone walls of briarcliff, time had no meaning.
the days themselves seemed to exist in a kind of perpetual twilight.
you were n't conceived in love, but in hate.
i could n't wait to give you up.
you're an abomination.
i was in the third week of my confinement, and a storm was coming.
the nor'easter of '64 that brought so much devastation with it, and for me, something else, something far more savage even than nature.
oliver thredson was, to all appearances, a kindly figure, fatherly in his manner.
this face he showed the world, this face of sanity and benevolence, that was his real mask.
underneath lurked the real oliver thredson, an unspeakable monster.
i loved you even when you were still in your mother's womb.
i would have given anything to be a real father to you, but she kept us apart.
she stole it from you.
from both of us.
the catholic church bought this place in '62, and turned it into a sanitarium for the criminally insane.
legend has it that once you were committed at briarcliff, you never got out.
the most famous resident was a serial killer named...
maybe it's bloody face.
maybe it's just old pipes.
i want to know what's in there.
do it again and i'll blow you.
and who did this drawing of you?
he was a bit tipsy on the airplane coming back from somalia and drew it on the cocktail napkin.
he's quite good, is n't he?
be sure and get an insert of that, pete.
so with six bestsellers, a reputation as the only one the men will open up to, world leaders, stars, disgraced politicians, who's the one that got away?
is there anyone you lusted after that you missed?
and she's still lusting after julian assange.
uh, look, i know
i said no on - camera appearances for you, but i love this whole bringing the chardonnay thing, super casual, loving.
what about just that?
i saw your norma at the met.
she's doing it in bologna this summer.
i've got rehearsal;
i'll be back by 5:00.
we have that sondheim dinner birthday thing tonight.
am i not the luckiest woman alive?
a little higher, babe.
mm- mm, higher still.
oh, what are they teaching these kids in film school?
god knows it's not how to make us old gals look more gorgeous.
nothing old about you, lana.
well, thanks to a very talented surgeon in paris and a great dermatologist.
so, what are we covering today?
well, since it's a kennedy center honor
i'd say it's a pretty big canvas.
jesus, darling, i hope this is n't going to feel like a eulogy.
i will certainly ask you about your notorious nail - to - the - cross prison interview with madoff.
i'd like to go back and start with the early years.
i said i would n't talk about that.
people want to hear about it.
it's what made you famous.
he's become a goddamn household name.
like some kind of heath ledger, hollywood movie star villain.
he was an evil monster who used murder and torture to keep himself from feeling like a eunuch.
i refuse to give him one more second of air time.
so then let's start with the event that made your reputation as a crusader for change, the briarcliff exposé.
we good to go, everyone?
honey, hand me that mirror, will you?
i like to do my own eyebrows.
like a million bucks.
but they're still not gonna let us in that front door with a camera.
oh, i know how to get in.
jesus, how did you find this place?
listen, when we get inside, no matter what happens, or what anybody says, you keep shooting.
we need to document the conditions, the filth, these people are forced to live in.
i want the footage to shock the public out of their complacency, you understand?
i want moral outrage.
i want to put america in the asylum.
the fact that you would voluntarily go back into the place where you almost died, that's why you were held in such high esteem by all of america and your peers.
did you always have this need for justice?
that's the myth.
lana winters, crusader.
it was n't justice that got me back to briarcliff.
you had an abrupt career change.
i knew television was the future.
so i got started in local news, then an nbc affiliate before i landed my own series of investigative reports.
with tv, words, they're less important.
but you need more than that.
you need an angle, a hook.
i heard from very reliable sources that sister jude, the nun that imprisoned me at briarcliff, was still alive.
in fact, she had become a patient there herself.
milo, i told you to keep rolling.
get the camera up and pointed at me.
at briarcliff manor, it's not uncommon to see patients left on their own without supervision, without stimulation, for hours on end.
the squalor, the filth, the decay of this institution is a shocking indictment of the abandonment of her most needy by the state of massachusetts.
the church sold briarcliff manor to the state of massachusetts in the fall of 1965.
since then, conditions have deteriorated.
you need a slate? are... yeah, are you sleeping?
since then, conditions have deteriorated.
these images and sounds are far more powerful than any words that can be spoken.
but how can i describe to you the way it smells?
it reeks of filth, of disease.
it smells of death.
do you... have permission to do this?
you are the first attendant we've seen the entire time we've been here.
is it the policy to leave patients unclothed and unclean, some of them smeared in their own feces?
right now i'm interested in one.
i demand to see judy martin.
do you remember me?
you were committed to briarcliff to cover up the abuses the church and science had perpetrated against patients here.
you were left to die.
i've come back to help you.
i'm going to get you out of here, sister jude.
such a powerful scene you describe.
that's because it never happened.
i should've gone back sooner.
but you did shut down briarcliff.
yes, but it's not the ending i wanted.
it was one hell of an ending, just not the one i wanted.
and there's your promo.
i need to freshen up.
ms. winters needs a break.
five and we're back.
would you like something to drink?
i'd love a sparkling water.
would you get ms. winters a sparkling water, please?
my pleasure, ms. winters.
i was just watching the news.
you really did it.
i wanted them to capture our reunion.
like who's betty drake?
and is she here?
i'll talk to you, lana, but... but i'm not gonna talk to your camera.
where'd you find this?
i was still trying to find jude.
jude had n't existed for years.
the monsignor saw to that.
betty drake, released to the care of kit walker,
march 27, 1970.
that was just a few months after you came to see me at the book signing.
it's jude, is n't it?
why do you care now, lana?
we all just part of your story?
it's not just my story, kit.
it's yours, too.
you went back for her.
cause it was something i could do.
i mean, i could n't shut the place down,
i could n't lead them all out of there like moses.
but, jude, whatever she was, she did n't belong there any more than we did.
after alma died, i...
you brought her into your home.
after all the indignities she made you suffer?
i did n't even really do it for me.
i did it for the kids.
for a while, things seemed to be going along pretty well, considering.
no matter how much she barked at them, they always understood something about her.
well, it got worse before it got better.
told you to start in the corner!
did you think i would n't notice?
i'll cane you!
this is not briarcliff, and you will not hit my kids!
what's going on here?
no, we do not have a children's ward!
i told your mother that.
i was very clear.
i was very clear!
you will address me as sister jude.
you do n't fool me, kit walker.
i know what you did.
no, you get away!
i wo n't go back in that hole!
- you ca n't make me!
get your sister and go outside.
no, you ca n't make me!
i still do n't know what happened in those woods.
when they came back... something was different.
those children are special.
okay, i'm gonna teach you a new step.
toe, heel, step back.
okay, now, start again, watch me.
you're left, and i'm right.
because women are always right.
do n't say i never taught you nothing.
daddy, dance with me.
let me show this to you.
for six months, she taught them how to swing dance and swear like a sailor.
made thomas learn to sew and took away julia's dolls and gave her trucks so she'd grow up tough.
i do n't know if those last six months made up for a lifetime of horrors... but she sure seemed happy.
come here, you two.
i got a few more things to tell you, okay?
julia, do n't you ever let a man tell you who you are or make you feel like you are less than he is.
and you can do anything you want.
find something... that you love.
oh, i do n't need that.
it's mushroom barley.
you got to eat something.
kids, why do n't you go pile up the leaves in the yard?
i'm staying with nana.
no, you guys, you should go outside and play.
kit walker... you're a lucky man.
you better not screw them up.
i'm not going to leave you alone.
she's here for me.
i do n't know who she was talking about.
are you sure you're ready this time?
i'm ready now.
i have a feeling we're about to enter the hard - hitting part of the interview.
it was the pen, was n't it?
no need to take notes on powder - puff questions.
you got me, but i'm gonna ask anyway.
if shutting down briarcliff was such an undeniable success, your next exposé was, to put it mildly, controversial.
i think half of new york wanted to lynch me, and the other half would have had me banned from the state.
can we talk about what happened with cardinal howard?
at the time, he was a powerhouse, a rising star in the church.
the man had avoided me for weeks.
i have nothing to say to you, miss winters.
with or without your comments, i'm airing a report tomorrow night on dr. arthur arden, a man you hired to run the medical unit at briarcliff.
we finally gained access to his files.
did you know he was conducting human experiments?
we found some very disturbing evidence.
would you mind switching that off, please?
a number of patients disappeared under his care.
do you have any idea what happened to them?
it was over seven years ago.
you ca n't expect me to remember anything about patients i was n't responsible for.
i'm afraid you are responsible.
and there is no statute of limitations on murder, cardinal howard.
the police have found remains, human bones in the woods outside briarcliff.
they're going to start asking hard questions.
and since the notorious dr. arden has disappeared, they're going to be looking to you for answers.
what are you running from, cardinal howard?
out of the way, miss winters!
what are you running from?
to this day, people still blame you for what happened to him.
i've got broad shoulders, but i ca n't take credit for what his guilty conscience made him do.
i have a feeling we're not just talking about cardinal howard anymore.
is there something you'd like to share with us?
i'm going to come clean about a lie
i've told for over 40 years.
i write about the abuse, the rape, the pregnancy.
i say that the baby died in childbirth.
i even wrote about a kind of poetic justice that the child had n't lived.
that child is alive.
i did n't raise him, but someone did.
do n't ask me to do that again.
i could n't muster it.
i tried, but i could n't.
that's quite a secret, lana.
the only person i've told is marian.
there was a period in the mid-'70s where i suffered a terrible remorse about giving him up.
i just needed to see him.
what you got in here?
shut up, asshole!
you back off before i hurt you in ways you have n't even dreamt of.
you know he's the asshole, right?
you should report him.
i was n't his mother.
i would only confuse him.
but i thought about him so often.
wondering where he was.
how he turned out.
did you ever think about having children after that?
it was a different time for gay women.
most of us were resigned to not having children.
but i was close to my friends' children.
kit walker... he asked me to be godmother to his kids.
kit got married again.
they grew up with that message, and they lived up to it.
thomas is a law professor at harvard.
julie is a leading neurosurgeon at johns hopkins.
kit would be so proud of them.
is he no longer with us?
when he was around 40, he developed pancreatic cancer.
they gave him chemo, but it was just a waiting game.
and no one could explain exactly what happened.
no note, no tracks, no clues.
kit's children insisted there was no reason to mourn.
ms. winters, i ca n't tell you what an honor this has been for me.
oh, try not to, darling.
i just hope you got what you need.
i thought we'd just be doing your greatest hits, but all the personal stuff... fantastic, unexpected and very moving.
can i pour you a drink?
why do n't you come out now?
you do n't need to hide.
so i guess you've had a pretty great life, huh?
it's been eventful.
it's about to end.
you get that, right?
i knew it the moment i saw you.
i do n't mind.
how did you manage to get yourself on the crew?
i've been waiting outside the building, got friendly with the doorman, he told me about the interview.
he's in the trash bin.
this is n't how i pictured it.
because this is exactly how i pictured it.
i always knew this day would come.
i did n't think you'd recognize me.
how could i not recognize my own baby boy?
48 years old, unmarried.
we think he's responsible for the deaths of at least five people.
including the elderly couple who lived in the house formerly owned by oliver thredson.
the place you were held at and tortured in '64, ms. winters.
are you sure you do n't recognize him?
you look like him, you know?
it's easy for me to forget just how handsome he was.
until you shot him in the head.
yes, i shot him in the head.
how did you find out?
that you murdered my father?
about who you were.
that day on the playground.
and i saw you on the tv.
"that's my mother," i'd tell people.
and they'd just laugh at me, but i knew.
and i dreamed one day that you'd come back.
then i heard the tape, and, uh...
i found it on ebay.
lana, no, please!
no baby should have to grow up knowing daddy is bloody face.
my father loved me.
that's when i started loving him.
he never loved you, johnny.
no, i did n't love you.
you'd have a chance at a life, you mean!
so what's it going to be, johnny?
i do n't imagine, at my age, you'd be much interested in the skin.
i've thought about this.
i've thought about this a lot.
i was n't expecting that.
your father once told me he did n't believe in guns.
of course, he was lying about that, too.
you do n't get to talk about him.
what are you so afraid of, johnny?
the truth about him or the truth about you?
i just want him to be proud of me.
i ca n't measure up.
he was a monster.
yes, he was.
no, he was n't.
but that's not you.
you could never be like him.
not that... sweet little boy i met on the playground.
even then, i knew you were a better man than he was.
i'm a part of you, too.
i've hurt people.
it's not your fault, baby.
that he's going to be admitted here today.
is there any way i could meet him?
you're out of your depth,
you want a story?
a girl like you, you like to dream large.
i'd venture you already have briarcliff in your rearview mirror.
no, i'm saying it's dangerous.
saving the souls of madmen and killers is a pretty lofty ambition, would n't you say?
and you can not imagine what it took to get here.
i'd love to hear your story someday.
i do n't think you and i are destined to meet again.
but i do hope you know what you're in for.
the loneliness, the heartbreak, the sacrifice you'll face as a woman with a dream on her own.
you do n't have any idea what i'm capable of.
look at you, miss lana banana.
just remember... if you look in the face of evil.
evil's going to look right back at you.
in the year 2026... archaeologists working in the nevada desert... discovered a portal to an ancient city on mars.
they called this portal the ark.
twenty years later, we're still struggling to understand... why it was built... and what happened to the civilization that built it.
this is dr. carmack, classified research, olduvai, id 6627.
implement quarantine procedures immediately.
implement quarantine procedures now.
union aerospace has requested assistance to contain... a level 5 breach at their olduvai facility.
how many personnel involved?
six scientists are under lockdown in a high - security lab... where the breach occurred.
another 79 uac employees are on site.
ark travel has been suspended.
what's the objective?
assess level of threat.
maintain quarantine at both ark portals by any means necessary.
if necessary, search and destroy.
i confess to god the father.
hey, relax, baby. we're on vacation.
this game's layered, man.
where you going, portman?
you're sick, man.
i'm sick of your filth, portman. he speaks.
what's it gonna be, reaps?
an armed conflict someplace quiet?
yeah, a little relaxing jungle warfare?
or maybe you're just gonna stay right here.
spending my time doing pushups.
got a problem with that, duke?
hell, no, i love my job.
what's up, sarge?
we got us a game.
all dressed up and nowhere to go, huh, portman?
shut up, portman.
not this time, john.
we can handle this one.
no, i'm not bullshitting.
we're going to olduvai.
is that an order?
almost like we've never been away.
okay, sarge, roger.
rrts special ops clearance verified.
say my name, baby.
i ca n't believe we're going through the ark.
do n't worry, kid.
you're gonna love it.
rrts air 6, we're airborne and en route.
the next day he brought you onto the team.
do n't give me an excuse, portman.
no one here will miss you.
men, look in.
this is what we got from simcon.
we have a quarantine situation on olduvai.
they sent this message... when the research team stopped responding to all communications.
this is dr. carmack, classified research, olduvai, id 6627.
implement quarantine procedures now.
we need to go up there, locate the team... eliminate the threat and secure the facility.
if it's trying to kill you, it's a threat.
rescue mission heading 147 degrees.
location lima, zulu, foxtrot 14.
sure she's even still up there?
i guess you gotta face your demon sometime.
look alive, men. game time.
i checked it... at least three times before we sent it through.
sanford crosby, uac public relations.
now follow me, please.
how many people you got up there?
uac employs 85 permanent research staff on olduvai.
welcome to the ark, gentlemen.
all personnel, prepare for activation.
keep your distance from the core or you might get sucked in.
you, uh, you done this before?
all telemetry verified and transmissions are five - by - five.
soon as we get through, i need you to shut down the surface elevator here.
make sure that we get the standard quarantine of six hours.
ark travel, 15 seconds and counting.
why we gotta come all this way?
is it always that rough?
believe me, it used to be a lot rougher.
there was a time when ark travel was susceptible to, let's say... major turbulence.
unbelievable as it may seem, uac does make the odd tiny mistake.
you call me pinky.
where are the personnel who are n't locked down in the lab?
pinky, put us up.
activating remote personnel surveillance.
circle out men, on my three.
people, this room is a code red, which means... no one gets in without our permission.
it stays ours at all costs.
mac, stay here with our friend and secure the door.
men, on me. let's move out.
who called in the military?
couple million light years from breakfast.
when can i start evacuating people out through the ark?
we're at a level 5 quarantine, nobody goes anywhere.
ladies, we're under a level 5 quarantine... so i'm just gonna have to strip search you girls.
sergeant, this is dr. samantha grimm, the uac science officer... assigned to retrieve data from the lab.
sarge, this operation is a code red.
we really do n't have room for passengers.
anthropology, forensic archeology, and genetics.
this is a military operation, doctor.
we're really not here to retrieve your science homework.
look, i got an idea.
why do n't you ask your co what your orders are?
to contain and neutralize the threat, protect the civilians... and retrieve -- retrieve uac property.
because i've got a job to do.
if you'll follow me?
you chose this, reaper.
is this gonna spoil my day?
tell me you did n't let a fine - looking piece of ass... like that get away from you, reaper.
she's my sister.
do n't do this again, man.
there's three sections to carmack's lab complex.
archeology, genetics, and weapons research.
well, it's a dead planet.
you want that stuff tested here, where it's safe, or in your own backyard?
we're primarily an archeological operation.
weapons research is in its own separate facility.
it has nothing to do with dr. carmack's work.
how many inside when the lab shut down?
only dr. carmack's team.
in one of the carbon dating labs, there was an internal phone... left off the hook.
did you get any information from it?
portman, goat, lead on.
magnesium, chromium, lead.
pinky, give us a schematic.
the airlock is the only way in or out.
carmack's office, where he sent the mayday from.
reaper, keep dr. grimm here safe on her salvage op.
duke and i'll take the weapons lab, make sure all the hardware's secure.
fluorescent markings as rooms are cleared.
you do n't look like a "mac."
pinky, you getting this?
where the hell is everybody?
there's another room to the north.
what the hell is that?
you never did time, portman?
this is a holding cell.
i'd hate to see what they lock up.
hey, sarge, what's the deal with the sister?
reaper's parents led the first team of archeologists to olduvai.
they died in some accident when he was a kid.
she followed in their footsteps, and he did n't.
no, what i meant was, is she single?
please provide dna verification.
all units report contact.
god damn it, all units report contact.
friendly fire, sarge.
as in "grim"?
oh, yeah, meet lucy.
lucy, this is my brother, john... another creature from the long lost past.
lucy and her child were our first major find.
we're bringing out more every day.
i know i should have told you.
i did n't figure it was the sort of thing...
i could jot down on a yearly birthday card.
it's been stabilized.
you wanna talk about safe?
like you took a desk job?
i'm a forensic archeologist, john.
i'll go where the work is.
is that the only reason you're up here?
you wanna know why i'm up here?
i'll show you. come here.
this is lucy's chromosome profile.
my molecular genetics is a little rusty.
what's the first thing dad taught us to look for?
she's got 24 pairs of chromosomes.
humans only have 23.
but what does the extra pair do?
the fossil record indicates these people had conquered disease.
so what, they were just naturally superior?
we suspect this extra chromosome may be synthetic.
that's a long word for a marine.
does it ever bother you... you could've spent your life looking in a microscope... instead of a sniper scope?
if they were so smart, how come they're so dead?
we do n't know.
maybe they just went with time.
you do n't shield a baby from time.
we got movement up ahead.
you stay here, okay?
there's something in carmack's office.
moving east through carmack's office!
moving fast, over south corridor.
sam, i told you to stay -- but he knows me, john.
dr. carmack, it's me.
i'm not gonna hurt you.
get a med kit.
i'm not gonna hurt you.
duke, get him to the infirmary with dr. grimm.
portman, kid, go to the airlock and dig in.
anything trying to get away from us will get driven straight to you.
now let's see if we can find the body that goes with that arm.
i tell you, man.
do you have any?
do i have any?
i'm just a little shook up.
i need something to get my focus, man.
there is a god.
i think we found the rest of that arm.
no, no, i do n't do nanowalls.
yes, you do.
my husband is with them.
i'm sure steve's fine.
dr. carmack, i'm going to take your blood pressure.
hey -- it's okay, it's okay.
i can feel it.
shut it, shut it down. shut it down.
that's affirmative, reaper.
looks like we missed the party.
we were just here.
we're here to help.
sir, are you okay?
we found another one of the scientists.
some kind of monkey.
there's something in his blood.
reaper, what have you got?
give me a confirmation on what you're seeing.
it's in the sewer.
southeast corridor near the med lab.
i can handle things here.
i want to stay.
steve is gonna be okay.
go on, go on. be with your daughter.
"no blood match." ca n't be good, right?
it leads back under the lab complex.
destroyer, cover the exit.
we got a dr. willits.
"because your adversary, the devil..." walketh about seeking whom he may devour. "
that's real comforting, goat.
that ai n't freaking me out at all.
quick, he's slipping back.
portman, what the hell happened?
i fell in the damn hole.
everybody, on me. watch your goddamn footing.
goat, straight ahead. sir.
portman, you're with me.
john, take the kid and go to the right.
you lost your folks, right?
small world. i mean, i lost my parents, too.
yeah, i mean, i woke up one morning... and everything was gone.
i mean, the only thing left was me.
they wanted the tv more than they wanted me.
your pupils are dilated.
no, i got this condition -- i do n't give a damn.
i'm sorry, look, i just needed a little
goat, i think there's something coming up on you.
my light is down.
goat, what's your position?
goat, where are you?
goat, speak to me.
god damn it, reaper, report to me.
everyone, get to the ark now!
hunegs, report to the quarantine zone.
evacuate the entire facility.
get everyone to the ark now.
get to the goddamn ark.
everybody to the ark.
let's get this vest off him.
now he's clear.
got a weak pulse.
come on, man.
kid, keep pressure on that wound.
how's the pulse?
sam, give me a shot of adrenaline.
we lost the pulse.
sam, give me that adrenaline.
okay, going again.
this is "what."
have you found anything like this... on your archeological digs?
the planet is completely dead.
it came from somewhere, lady.
portman, shut up!
the atmosphere on the surface ca n't support life.
maybe it does n't need air.
it could have come from another planet or something.
look at that thing!
that is n't what goat and i shot at in genetics.
where are your surface entry points?
there's a pressure door at the end of the north corridor.
destroyer, kid, portman, get there on the double.
give me an update.
whatever this thing is... it can not get back through the ark.
mac, i want you to arm pinky with a weapon... with some st grenades, and seal the ark door.
there's one other door.
the entrance to the archeological dig.
ark portal activation in progress.
do n't let anything through the ark.
hey, wait. wait a minute.
you ca n't leave me here.
i'm not a soldier.
you're supposed to protect me.
remaining personnel, ready for evacuation.
do n't be a wuss.
little tension between you and reaper?
why does a talented student throw it all away and join the rrts?
so, what was he like before?
it's kind of hard for me to imagine reaper as sensitive.
you know, we grew up together.
you know, duke, i bet secretly you have a big heart.
and that's not the only secret big thing i got.
oh, lady, you have no idea.
i need a power bone saw.
girl, i've been waiting on you my whole life.
down the corridor, on the left, through the nanowall.
for you i got it, 'cause you're pretty.
i would n't do it for a dude, you know.
we're going back in through the airlock.
we're not calling in backup?
the ark is sealed.
pick up your weapon, portman.
did n't y'all see how that thing greased goat?
we do n't know what we're dealing with here.
we are... the reinforcements.
all uac personnel evacuated to earth.
it's just a power shortage.
here's your bone saw.
so, which of you is the oldest?
oh, me. by two minutes.
sam, get back in the lab.
and that's why i do n't do nanowalls.
pinky, we're entering the archeological dig.
not too close, john.
did you find the door?
they were n't trying to stop something from getting in.
mac, stand by.
console indicates nothing's come in or out for 26 hours.
talk to me, mac.
we're in pursuit.
moving fast out of the dig.
it's getting away.
pinky, what do you see?
it's back in the lab.
damn, it's fast.
all around defense, men.
did you get it?
anything gets through that door... use an st grenade.
it can not get back to earth.
he pops an st in there, he's gonna blow the ark.
reaper, kid, pairs, cover formation.
destroyer, you and portman stay here.
i'm going to the armory.
you see anything like it before?
dogs got kidneys, right?
it's had its appendix removed.
goat knew he was turning.
this thing did n't butcher willits.
please provide dna verification.
welcome, patricia tallman.
portman, i got floor and wall on your gun cam.
lost portman on comm... and all i've got on destroyer is a wall.
portman, come in.
this is corporal dean portman... with rrts 6 special ops on olduvai, 0310 hours.
i repeat, require immediate rrts reinforcements.
destroyer, portman, where the hell are you?
pinky, you got portman?
i got him, i got him.
destroyer, i got you, man.
and whose goddamn blood is on that window?
what do you mean, he killed himself?
he was already dead.
we found two more scientists at the dig.
thurman and a balding guy with glasses.
did you check their necks?
were there open wounds on their necks?
we were conducting a firefight, not an autopsy.
we came up here to find six scientists.
four are known dead... and dr. willits is probably kia somewhere down in that sewer.
the only one missing is dr. carmack.
has dr. carmack showed up yet?
look at the left ear.
i think this other one is steve willits.
i'm going to run the dna, check it against his med records.
what are you people working on up here?
we're analyzing bones, artifacts.
we're not doing anything like this.
it must be a genetic mutation, something environmental or viral.
it may even be reversible.
because carmack's condition is that... he's dead.
kid, you and duke... get back to the dig and you make sure those other dead scientists... are really dead.
i've lost... four soldiers.
what are you people experimenting with up here?
i'm not gonna ask you again.
i told you, it's an archeological research center.
do you think i'm lying to you?
you think i'm hiding something?
i'm telling the truth.
vitals normal, elevated heart rate attributable to subject anxiety.
he reconstructed chromosome mutation on a human subject.
we were never gonna do human studies.
what the hell are we looking at?
genesis, chapter 1.
49 minutes after injection, genetic mutations... began to visually manifest on subject's extremities.
this is what you're here to protect.
they lied to you.
they used you, sam.
we need to destroy these discs.
that's uac property.
we take the data back.
sarge, do you not see what's going on here?
i have my orders.
i said, is this everything?
i, uh, have three more to download.
one dead scientist is missing.
you just wanna leave her here?
she's got a job to do.
pinky, are you there?
something is cutting through the ark door.
do n't let it get to the ark!
pinky, use the grenade!
quarantine cordon is breached.
this mission is no longer containment.
get all the weapons and ammo you can.
sam, come in.
sam, do you read me?
time required to begin renewed operation... four minutes and 45 seconds.
come in, sam!
why did they take goat and not destroyer?
why carmack and not dr. thurman?
lucy had the 24th chromosome... but she was n't a monster.
she died protecting her child, not devouring it.
why did the same chromosome that made her superhuman... turn stahl into a monster?
just give me a minute.
we do n't have a minute.
then give me 10 seconds.
this is its tongue.
this is brain matter from portman.
this is from destroyer.
it's choosing, john.
it's choosing who to infect.
how is it choosing?
there are genetic markers for psychotic and violent behavior.
it could be a specific neurotransmitter... it's picking up on, a ganglion.
latching onto numbers in the dna code linked to --
ten percent of the human genome is still unmapped.
some say it's the genetic blueprint for the soul.
maybe c - 24 is what destroyed the population.
it would explain why some of them had to build the ark... to escape to a new beginning.
some it made superhuman.
we gotta get out of here now.
the people quarantined on the other side of the ark... they wo n't all be infected!
sarge is going to kill them all.
nothing gets to the elevator back on earth.
we ca n't let them get to the surface.
if it breathes, kill it.
five... four, three... two, one.
this is corporal dean portman... with rrts 6 special ops on olduvai, 0310 hours.
we have encountered hostile activity.
require immediate rrts reinforcements.
we got 58 minutes before the auto lockdown is lifted.
reset it for another six hours.
it's been disabled.
they're disabling computers now?
yeah, they're rocket scientists, remember?
sarge, what's your position?
sarge, come in.
come in, sarge.
do you read me?
look, do not kill everybody.
i repeat, do not kill everybody.
they're not all infected.
clear the rest of this sector and meet back at the ark chamber.
jesus christ, what the hell are
who the hell's in there?
you do n't have to kill all of them.
i do n't think everyone is infected, or even capable of being infected.
we have orders to contain this threat by any means necessary.
and we have orders to protect this facility.
we do n't have orders to kill innocent people.
we have to stop anything from getting to the surface... by any means... necessary.
am i glad to see you guys.
that thing cut right through the door.
i tried to use the grenade but it came at me too fast.
followed me through the ark and started to kill everybody.
there's no wound on his neck.
i say who's clean... and who's not.
i mean, it was n't my fault.
hey, i'm not a soldier.
you should n't have left me --
there's a storeroom to the south.
we gotta do something.
your orders were to clear that sector.
no, i told them to stay put.
they're just scared shitless.
we kill them all.
let god sort them out.
i think - son, you do n't think.
we're in the field, soldier.
sarge, if nothing's found them --
you will obey the direct order... of your commanding officer.
mutinous insurrection is punishable... by death.
it was his first mission!
and it's not gonna be my last.
i do n't need anybody else but soldiers.
i have no intention of being killed by a madman.
the wall's not closing!
i'm not supposed to die.
how long before they get through?
this is an st grenade.
when they come through... you pop the top and hit the button.
john, stay with me.
john, stay with me, please.
it's c - 24.
it's from carmack's lab.
it could save you.
no way, forget it.
you're bleeding to death.
no way, sam.
i've done some bad things.
one through the heart, one through the head... do n't you hesitate.
last man standing, reaper.
i think she needs medical attention.
can you get to the elevator?
i'm not sure.
i took care of that problem.
quarantine's almost over.
power should be back on any minute.
you killed the kid.
it's what they pay us for.
elevators back on line.
what do you say we go outside and get some fresh air?
are you gonna shoot me?
yeah, i was thinking about it.
i've got one round.
faithful to the corps, john.
"go to hell."
in a land of myth and time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests of shoulders on a young boy.
the wound is superficial.
he should be fine by morning.
what creature could've done this?
we found no tracks in or out.
what the villagers say must be true.
.. and it took no livestock - only people.
whatever it is, it has a taste for human flesh.
post sentries at all the outlying villages.
put the lookouts on full alert.
if this thing should make for camelot, we must be ready.
ever since i was a child, i've dreamed of coming here.
it's my life's ambition to join the knights of camelot.
i know what you're thinking.
i... i expect too much.
after all, who am i?
they have their pick of the best and bravest in the land.
they're going to love you.
i've seen you in action.
i hardly think so.
in fact, you know what i'll do?
i'll talk to him right now.
right, you jumped - up dung beetle, this is it final test.
pass this and you're knight at camelot,
fail, and you're no - one.
you face the most feared of all foes, the ultimate killing machine.
your challenge - the last one minute, free combat.
grimond, second son of wessex.
your times starts now.
he's the third to fail this month.
how can i defend camelot with rubbish like that?
you have no idea what it takes to be knight courage, fortitude, discipline.
no, of course i do n't.
he's really good, honestly.
i'm sure he's terrific.
you forget camelot's first code.
only noblemen can be knights.
so unless your friend is a nobleman...
bring him to the training ground tomorrow.
make sure he brings his seal of nobility.
you wo nt't regret it.
did you speak to him?
he'd like to meet you.
hey, it's no problem, really.
you're not a nobleman by any chance, are you?
good lord, no.
why do you ask?
the first code of camelot states that only those of noble blood can serve as knight.
uther created the knights to protect this kingdom from those who wish to destroy it.
he knew he'd have to trust each of his knights with his life.
so he chose those who'd sworn allegiance to him.
thus the first code of camelot was born.
and ever since that day, only sons of noble families have served as knights.
that is not fair.
fair or unfair, that's the way it is.
i'm sorry, lancelot.
why do you want to be a knight so much?
when i was a boy, my village was attacked by raiders from northern plains.
they were slaughtered where they stood - my father, my mother, everyone.
i vowed that day that never again would i be helpless in the face of tyranny.
i made swordcraft my life.
every waking hour since that day i devoted to the art of combat.
when i was ready, i set forth for camelot.
and now it seems my journey ends.
everything i've fought for - wasted.
i give you my word, whatever it takes, i will make this right.
come on, come on yes!
it's, um, a real page - turner.
this is your seal of nobility.
ladies and gentlemen, i give you lancelot, fifth son of lord eldred of northumbira.
no, merlin, no.
so you do n't want to be knight then.
the rules do n't allow it?
but it's a lie.
it's against everything that stands for.
you have as much right to be a knight as any man.
but the rules, merlin...
we're not breaking the rules.
after that, you'll be judged on your merit alone.
and if you succeed, if they make you a knight, it'll be because you have earned it, noble or not.
i ca n't change the way things are done here, but you can... if you let me help you.
then thank you, guinevere.
merlin would do anything for anyone.
sorry, can you raise your arms?
i think it's great that merlin's got you this chance.
well, not me personally but, you know, camelot.
not just arthur and his kind, but ordinary people like you and me.
i'm not a knight yet, my lady.
and i'm not a lady.
ok, we're done.
i should have these ready in no time.
it's nice to meet you, lancelot.
oh, yeah, yeah, she is.
and the best seamstress in camelot, i promise.
are you two... you know?
you certainly look the part.
does n't he just?
i do nt feel it.
that'll do for today.
here's your chance.
lancelot, fifth son of lord eldred of northumbria.
my servant mentioned you.
on a battlefield, you'd be dead by now.
come back when you're ready.
i'm ready now, sire.
you are, are you?
you can start by cleaning out the stables.
i'm sorry about lancelot.
i could see you were upset.
oh... you know, that's life.
you're taking it very well.
i have to say.
how'd it go?
he found work at the stables.
and the truth, before i lose my temper.
he's, uh... trying out for the knights.
the first code of camelot has never been broken for any man.
what have you done, merlin?
i bent the rules a little.
but they're wrong, they're unfair.
you bent the rules using magic?
it was nothing, honestly.
it was more of a trick than actual magic.
your magic is not toy for you to use or abuse as you see fit.
then why did you do it?
i owe lancelot my life.
i am paying for that debt the only way i can by giving him the opportunity he deserves.
would you like me sweep the guardhouse agian, sire?
it certainly needs sweeping.
first, i'd like you to kill me.
do n't pretend you do nt want to.
hell, if i were you, i'd want to.
you just made basic trainning.
their village was attacked by a winged monster.
i'd hunt this thing, but i ca nt track a creature through the air.
you do nt have to track it.
first greensward, then willowdale.
it's heading south towards the mouth of the valley.
you must prepare your knights, arthur.
we'll be ready.
the beast is heading for camelot.
it's fast and agile, but big enough to hit and to hit hard.
starting today on training routines, we'll concertrate on an attack strategy.
we do nt have much time.
is there anything i can do, sire?
i knwo in the event of battle, only a knight may serve.
that's correct and you are not yet a knight, which is why i'm bringing your test forward.
you can face me in the morning.
well, here we are - your final challenge.
succeed and you join the elite.
lancelot, fifth son of lord eldred of northumbria your time starts now.
do you submit, sire?
arise, sir lancelot, knigh of camelot.
who is this man?
he seems to have come out of nowhere.
you do us a great honour, sir lancelot.
the knighthood is the very foundation of camelot.
the honour is all mine, sire.
you father would be very proud.
i've not seen lord eldred for many years, longer than i'd imagined it seems.
last time i saw him, he only had four sons.
and i've kept you too long already.
take this seal to geoffrey of monmouth, the court genealogist.
look at him, gaius.
dose lancelot not deserve this moment?
i never said he did n't.
you played god, merlin.
you set him on a path of your choosing.
you brought him triumph but the future is uncertain.
i do nt know what it said in you invitation, but in mine, it said celebration.
do n't come back too late.
yes sire, i do.
yeah, i suppose she is.
i think our sir lancelot might have eyes for you, gwen.
would it be so bad?
he's not really my type.
well, there's a surprise.
sometimes i wonder if you'd know your type, if he was standing right next to you.
so come on - just for the sake of argument, if you had to, arthur or lancelot?
i do n't have to and i never will.
oh, you are no fun, gwen.
ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to our new recruit, our new knight of camelot, sir lancelot.
two yards of ale?
two miles, more like.
do nt smell it, just down it in one.
ca n't have you nodding off first day on the job, lancelot.
sir lancelot, if you do nt mind.
tell him what you told me.
these credentials are faked.
the seal itself is faultless.
forgery of the highest possible standard, but a forgery it must be.
there is no record of a fifth son of lord eldred of northumbria.
- therefore, he
do you deny it?
you've broken the first code of camelot.
you've brought shame upon yourself and upon us.
you're not worthy of knighthood.
you never were and you never will be.
get him out of my sight.
but he meant no harm, sire. i'm sure of it.
he only wished to serve.
the first code is a sacred bond of trust.
it is what binds the knights together.
how can you trust a man who's lied to you?
i do n't know what to say to you, lancelot.
- you're not to blame.
- yes, i am.
i made you lie.
the choice was mine.
my punishment is mine to bear, and mine to bear alone.
i wish there was something i could do.
you can stop blaming yourself.
whatever you do, you do n't say i told you so.
i have no wish to gloat.
what's done is done.
here, come and take a look at this.
i've realised my mistake.
i've been looking for the creature in the wrong place,
the records of all known living things in the kingdom.
what about creatures only recorded in legend? in myth?
and i just discovered this.
you said your knights were the best in the land.
all i know is it's still out there.
the kingdom has been menaced by this creature for too long.
we finish this now.
sire, if i may?
i've researched this creature, sire.
i believe it to be a griffin.
what's in a name?
griffin is a creature of magic.
i do n't have time for this, physician.
it is born of magic, sire, and it can only be killed by magic.
it's a creature of flesh and blood like any other.
arthur proved that today.
i'm not so sure, father.
i think there may be some truth in what he says.
our weapons were useless against it.
the next time will be its last.
when will your knights be ready to ride again?
an hour, maybe two.
we finish this tonight.
is it true... that the griffin can only be killed by magic?
i'm certain of it.
if arthur rides out against it, he'll die.
then he must be stopped.
uther must see reason.
where magic is concered, our king is blind to reason.
and yet, magic is our only hope.
you're not suggesting...
it is your destiny, merlin.
the true purpose of your magic.
you saw it, gaius.
i ca n't go up against that thing.
but if you do not, then arthur will surely perish.
i do n't have magic that powerful.
this's the only way.
do you even care what's happening to me?
kill the griffin, merlin!
i just sit here warm my feet by fire
i would give my life for you without a thought.
i ca nt save arthur.
it is not my destiny.
i do nt know what else i can say.
then i'll say it for you.
we have two hours to find a way to kill that thing.
i should have known.
how could i have been so stupid?
you do n't look like a knight!
because you fight like a knight.
- we could not kill it.
i have never faced its like.
i faced it myself, sire.
some days past. i struck it full square.
i wondered how it endured.
there are those that believe this creature, this griffin, is a creature of magic, that only magic can destroy it.
do you believe this?
it does nt matter what i believe, the use of magic is not permitted.
the knights must prevail with steel and sinew alone.
there's a horse waiting outside.
no, please, it's not my freedom i seek.
i only wish to serve with hornour.
then let me ride with you.
my father knows nothing of this.
i release you, but can do no more.
now go before i change my mind.
you must do this for arthur.
i've never cast a spell of enchantment this powerful.
you have it within you.
we've plenty of time.
sorry to disturb you, my lady.
lancelot, what are you doing here?
there's no time, i need weapons, armour.
i must do what i can to protect him.
it's my duty, knight or not.
you really believe that, do nt you?
lancelot, i do n't believe i've ever met your like before.
guinevere, if i should not return...
but go i must.
do nt worry, merlin, i know you're trying.
lancelot's ridding out to kill the griffin!
no, you're not.
try and stop me.
you're not a soldier.
arthur needs all the help he can get.
it's now or never.
you did it, my son.
not i, father.
father, i can explain.
you have no right to...
what are they doing?
i confess it, sire.
i released him. i'll take the consequences.
but surely lancelot's actions change things.
he broke the code.
he laid down his life for me!
he served with honour.
i see you feel strongly about this, arthur.
under the circumstances, a pardon, perhaps.
not good enough, father.
you must restore lancelot to his rightful place,
as a knight of camelot.
the code bends for no man!
then the code is wrong!
they'll restore your knighthood, of course they will.
you killed the griffin.
your secret's safe with me.
but i can not take credit for what i did not do.
there'll be no more lies.
the only thing i can do.
i'll hear him.
forgive me, sire.
i've come to bid you farewell.
i lied to you both, and now there is conflict between you.
i can not bear that burden, as you should not bear mine.
i must start again, far from here.
then maybe one day fate shall grant me another chance,
to prove myself a worthy knight of camelot.
but, lancelot, you've already proved that to us.
but i must prove it to myself.
your highness. prince arthur.
perhaps you were right, gaius.
i should never have got involved.
lancelot needed you and you needed lancelot.
will he ever return?
that i can not say.
till next time, then...
my name is edwin muirden and i have a remedy to cure all ills.
we can not preserve her life for much longer.
she has hours, maybe less.
i wonder what uther will do.
probably have him burnt.
there's 4 of you.
never change the deal.
well, this is a new deal.
so we'll stop and get more gas!
every exposure... increases the risk of getting caught.
an extra 80 kilos means the koni shock absorbers... i installed for this job will not give us... the ability to outmaneuver... any police that might be chasing us.
which means, if there is a chase... we lose our advantage, which also increases... the possibility of getting caught.
i do n't want to get caught.
you do n't want to get caught.
and who's going to drive?
not without the ignition code you wo n't.
3 men. 254 kilos.
see what i mean about the shocks?
now it's time.
move it, marcel, move it!
we're going the wrong way!
stop it, marcel, stop!
look out, look out! whoa!
take us to the drop point!
what are you doing?
do n't stop now!
come on, do something!
what are you thinking?
your gun, please.
i'm fed up with this car chase!
you gave me too much.
we need you to take us to avignon.
the deal was this far and no further.
rules are meant to be broken.
oh, yeah, well, how come... you do n't have your yellow card with you?
yeah, they all say that.
"left it back in nam on the base." uh - huh.
let me show you what we do to people... who left it back in nam on the base.
please let go of me!
you gotta be punished for not carrying... your shot record on you.
the argentinian government reaffirmed... it s commitment to meeting... the i.m. f's target this year.
and yesterday, in nice... 4 men robbed the alliance investment corporation.
one man died on the sidewalk.
the others were apprehended early this morning... when they took a wrong turn on a one - way street... in avignon and ran into a taxi cab.
the police said... were it not for their poor driving habits... the 20 million euros in bearer bonds... would have been cashed and gone by this afternoon.
and in other news...
i'd say that's probably true, inspector.
you have a good sense of humor... for a foreigner, monsieur frank.
just the right amount of flavor.
until they pass a law that says i ca n't.
you want to come in for a coffee?
uh, thank you... but i have a lot of stops to make.
that's a lot of stops.
oh, it's a very popular car... with a certain type down here.
you've seen them.
they come over from italy... in those very expensive suits... and the young pretty girls... with the big jewelry and too much make - up.
there was a robbery.
by someone in a 1999 black bmw 735?
with 06 on the plate.
you have been in the city lately?
not for a while.
the food... the way they grill fish.
no place else in france does it... the way they do in nice.
i prefer the women there.
i do n't particularly like complicated.
you like to keep it simple.
why are you so interested?
oh, you know, uh... ever since i'm a little boy... military people have always intrigued me.
i'm an ex-little boy.
sure you do n't have time for a coffee?
everything is always... so neat with you, monsieur frank.
i'll take that as a compliment... coming from a man who pays attention to every detail.
maybe i'll come back later for that coffee.
door's always open to you.
lupo gave me your number.
i'm looking for a transporter.
one bag, that's it.
one meter fifty by half meter.
50 kilos, not more.
you're delivering to mister...
7:00 in the morning at the front door.
a package, one meter fifty by fifty... 50 kilos, 250 kilometers... travelling within the speed limit... one stop for refreshments... 40,000.
half now, half on delivery.
delivery will be at noon.
if no one's there, it is not my responsibility.
i'll leave the package.
once we make a deal... the terms of that deal can not be changed... or renegotiated.
it's rule number one.
transportation is a precise business.
now, do n't move.
i'm not gonna hurt you.
i'm just gonna make a little hole... so you can drink.
that's all i'm gonna do.
ok, ok, that's enough.
i'm going to take the tape off.
if you scream, i'll have to kill you.
you want me to do it in your car?
it's to cut you free.
you do n't need your mouth to pee.
you have one minute.
you're breaking the rules, frank.
not good to break the rules.
do n't make me drag you out.
never look in the package.
hope you enjoyed your pee... because it's your last on this trip.
ran into a little problem.
you open the package?
never open the package.
you ca n't get anything done in the world without rules.
you're a foreigner, right?
high class, good reputation.
i did n't get your name.
you do n't count it?
you know, i was wondering... if you would n't mind... transporting something for me.
that's what you do, right?
oh, maybe a kilo.
i know, you wanna pee.
all you wanna do is pee.
just keep it simple.
my name is lai.
you want to try again?
i wo n't say any...
i ca n't think straight when i'm tired.
i always see things better.
hey... are you comfortable?
the transporter's dead.
you told them nothing, right?
let's keep it that way.
i picked them from the garden outside.
i hope you do n't mind.
i did n't know if you like coffee... or tea, so i made both.
i like it quiet in the morning.
quiet in the morning.
i'm the same way.
i like very quiet.
are you looking for milk?
there's milk at the door.
is monsieur frank in?
is your invitation for coffee still open?
sure, come on. please, sit.
i'll bring some more.
my mother used to make... fresh madeleines every morning.
i smell them and my whole childhood... comes back in one big flood... like proust.
you ever read proust, monsieur frank?
memory like a steel trap.
he would have been a great cop.
a real detail man.
i used to have a memory like proust.
like a filing cabinet up there.
i would see something and remember it like that.
like, uh, license plates.
i could see a plate and it was printed in my head.
now i need all the help i can get... remembering whose plate... goes with whose car.
like, uh, this one.
where's the rest of the car?
i was hoping you could tell me.
- it was stolen.
yeah, i went down to frejus to pick up a few things.
did you report it?
it's the first on my list of things to do today.
it's a long walk from frejus.
how did you get home?
mm, a risky thing.
picking up a stranger on a dark road.
he had a kind face.
i did n't see a car outside.
it's in the garage.
may i see it?
pretty nice car for a cook.
some people have a problem with the germans.
they take up the best beaches in summer.
they ca n't cook worth a damn.
i would say your intuition worked out very well... for monsieur frank, mademoiselle.
worked out for both of us.
my intuition says this is probably a good time... for me to go file my report.
where's the rest of my car?
it was blown to pieces at a rest stop.
what's left of it is down at the lab.
they're trying to separate what was left... of the 2 cops in the trunk... from the rest of it.
but, uh, you would n't know anything about that?
thank you for the coffee and the memories.
come back any time.
would you mind walking me?
less work for mother.
but this business at the rest stop.
that is not very quiet.
i do n't suppose you would like to tell me... something besides a stolen car story?
if i had one i would.
well, may i suggest that when the 2 of you... show up in my office after lunch... you do have one.
a better one than you currently have.
you are the one he wants to see... not me!
please, i have to think.
you were supposed to think last night.
yeah, well, last night i had nightmares... about a girl who came into my nice, quiet life... screwed it all up.
i'm still wondering if i want to know everything... or nothing about you.
no, do n't stay there!
come on, give me your hand!
come on, get in!
come on, you wanna die?
calm down, ok?
is this your house?
i should mind my own goddamn business.
a simple, little rule.
there's gotta be some dry clothes... in this house.
do n't open the package.
nothing but trouble, you open the goddamn package.
making up for the trouble.
i do n't like it when things get complicated.
you like things simple.
i'm not so clear about the house.
after you left, we went for a walk on the beach.
did you see anybody else swimming?
so, you took a walk, had a swim... on a beach where no one else was swimming... past the point where you ca n't see... or be seen from the beach on either side... which makes witnesses a little hard to come by.
that's the point of a romantic swim.
then we came back to the house... found it on fire.
and the 5,000 rounds of spent ammo... my men found all around the house?
maybe they had the wrong house.
monsieur frank... people with this kind of firepower... do not make mistakes about who they visit.
who would want you this dead?
any problems with a client?
i do n't have clients.
i live on my army pension, you know that.
you have all the facts of who i am... and who i was.
you've had them for years.
any enemies you can think of?
people from the past?
i left the past behind when i moved here.
i'll just be a moment.
what are you doing?
you just need a password.
what, are you nuts?
we're in a police station.
except when we make love.
so, where will you be staying?
well, my cousin has a small hotel.
thanks, but we'll manage.
without money, it would be hard.
it's not much... but at least you wo n't go hungry.
going to see that guy.
you're not coming?
i'll buy a new one.
he burned your house.
i'll rebuild it.
he tried to kill you!
and as far as he knows, he succeeded.
look, i'm going to give you some advice.
i do n't know what you were into.
i do n't care what you were into.
but whoever wanted you dead... thinks you're dead.
there are 400 people dying... in a container on a ship.
the ship arrives today.
they will make my father a slave.
the only one who knows the container number... is that guy.
the moment you saw those pictures in my house... you were setting me up to get involved in this.
not everything is a lie.
name one thing that is n't?
what happened in the house... between us... that was not a lie.
your job was to save people.
this time... i care.
no phone calls for half an hour?
put your hands where i can see'em.
i have one question for you.
why'd you try to kill me?
you lied to me.
you opened the package.
you broke the rules.
what's the ship number?
i wo n't answer any more... so i suggest you kill me right now... and go screw yourself.
i ca n't find anything.
oh, poor frank.
we're smuggling people in containers?
i tell you, "lai" 's the perfect name for her.
mr. kwai's on the way up.
your father's here.
he'll really get a kick out of this.
i thought your father was in a container.
i mean, no.
there are 400 people in that container.
stay where you are!
she's a real heartbreaker, is n't she, frank?
10 seconds, 2 choices.
the information on the paper or your brains on the desk!
now tell me i'm lying!
lai, give me the gun.
i do n't know what you're talking about.
would i kill my own daughter?
she thinks we're smuggling people in containers.
i do n't know where you get these ideas!
would you kill your own father?
please... i am begging you.
i do what i do.
i'll never change.
but if you do n't... get this gun out of my face!
i know he's innocent.
oh, you have such a good heart.
always interested in saving innocent people.
well, here's your big chance.
drop your gun... and you will save one.
i need him to wrap something up.
just for the record... there are n't 400 people in that container.
am i glad you're here.
this man used my partner's daughter here... to try and blackmail us.
luckily, my security got the drop on him.
kidnapping... extortion, assault.
well, i suppose in your business... you have to know all types.
now, should i call my lawyer?
we'll handle it.
i'll expect all of you... down at my office to give your statements.
as soon as i contact my lawyer... we'll be more than happy to oblige.
the doctor said you will have a headache... for a few days and then everything... will go back to normal.
ah, i think you should be more concerned... with where you are.
oh, well, with the charges they filed... you will not be getting out... for a very long time.
assaulting a distinguished member... of the international business community... kidnapping his daughter... extortion.
i'm sorry, frank.
i would like to help you... but if you continue with the same old story...
"i am retired, living on a pension..."
for once, i need the truth.
they're smuggling people.
from asia through marseilles... in containers.
you know this for fact?
"never believe the cook."
she's not the cook.
you know, frank... no one is perfect.
so you're saying you're gonna do nothing?
no, i'm saying...
i'm going to start an investigation.
and in the meantime, the 400 people... in that container could be dead already.
but what am i supposed to do?
at least with me, it does n't take 12 months... to get the job done.
oh, yes, i know.
that's what i admire about you, frank.
all that army training... all that sneaking around... a man like you could probably resolve this case... in, how long?
you would be the perfect man for the job.
yes... if i were out.
yes... if you were out.
anybody moves and i kill him.
if this is how you transport... i'm amazed you get any work at all.
come on and give me a hand.
maybe i should go with you?
thanks, but, uh, i'm better alone.
that is a very small boat... to fight a very big war.
but it's a good boat.
the shipment's cleared.
here's the paperwork.
go straight to the warehouse.
we'll be right behind you just in case.
ok, we are ready to go.
i spent thousands of dollars... for you to go to school and learn english.
the least you can do is speak it.
i'm still your father.
get her out of here!
i'm looking to do a little sightseeing.
this plane is not for tourists.
i'm not a tourist.
call this guy and tell him to meet me.
- no, dad, stop!
hands on your head.
if she moves or i do n't return... shoot her!
i'm really not in the mood for a swim.
so, how did a lowlife like you... end up with my daughter?
is n't that where you left her?
the delivery will be made.
my daughter will get over it.
if i'm lucky, maybe she'll see the light.
yeah, if she's lucky maybe you'll get hit by a truck.
what do you know?
i know she'll never stop being who she is... and she'll never be you or anything like you.
she'll come around... but you wo n't be here to see it.
i guess she wo n't be coming around after all.
i'd rather see it coming.
makes no difference to me.
pretty impressive timing, frank.
mom was right about you!
- you're my sister and i do love you!
- what are you doing?
what are you doing?
cameron, get up, i'm leaving soon.
- cameron, get up, now!
- i've been planning this retreat for months, the least you could've done is gotten up early and helping out around here.
- i do n't want eggs.
- angie you love eggs.
- angie, eat it.
- jesus, joey, take it.
- you guys stop, enough, take this.
now, cameron, i need help packing!
- oh, my god. geez, why am i getting yelled at?
uncle joey does n't do anything around here.
- what the hell is his problem?
for the same reason she lets us live here, we're family.
- one minute, mom.
- eliza, i ca n't find my pills.
will you please help me finish packing?
and get my sleeping bag from the cellar?
uncle cameron, i have something to show you.
i told you, i'm working on it.
why does n't grandma like mom?
she just does n't want you around her when she's sick.
i made a painting for mom.
- where is the baby going?
i'm trying to grab his hand to stop him from going to heaven.
do you remember your twin brother?
well, it's beautiful, and your mom's gonna love it.
for the last time, i do n't want angie around her, move!
mom, she has the right to see her real mother.
- did you forget you're an alcoholic?
i've been sober for 12 years.
yeah, well, mom, when you were getting sober you still had the right to see us.
cameron, i was drinking, caitlin's a junkie!
so those mistakes make her less fit to be a mom than you?
oh, that's it, move, this discussion is over.
- hey, someone's cranky.
listen, i pray for caitlin, i do.
but i lost one grandchild because of her, and i'm not gonna lose another, okay?
listen, uncle joey said that he'd help with angie, all right, so no fighting, promise?
you trust douchebag uncle joey with angie but not caitlin?
stop in, and aunt jean is gonna come this weekend, check in, all right?
- what am i, five?
besides, it'll give you the night off, okay?
- you worry too much.
- i worry too much?
come here, give me a hug, i'm an expert at it.
i'll miss you, be good.
yeah, i wo n't burn down the house or kill anybody or anything, so.
i love you too, mom.
- come find me, uncle cameron!
- hey, let me out!
- give me one good reason to let you out.
now, uncle cameron!
when you go to college, who's gonna come find me here?
looks like i'm not going to college.
- are you ready to go see momma?
- but grandma said we ca n't go.
i'm in charge now, and i say it's okay.
but if you say one word, though, lady.
where are you taking her?
i'm taking her to the zoo.
trying to stay on track and keep going to work.
- what's going on over there?
- there's been awful fights all week.
- did you call the cops?
in this neighborhood, there's really no point.
around here, it's better to mind your own business.
uncle cameron, do n't go!
- get her away, man!
- you're letting him get away.
what the hell are you doing here?
he was the last one!
- what happened, just tell me what happened.
i'm here to help!
- are you bleeding?
- this is all your fault.
- i ca n't believe you let him get away.
- my sister is calling the cops.
- i have to save my baby.
- we're here to help!
let me help you!
- what's wrong with her?
- she'll be okay.
listen, let's let the cops deal with this one.
what if she caught whatever that baby had?
you better get out ta here.
- just call me, okay?
all right, take her. come on, baby.
where's your mother?
nanny, she went on a retreat.
let me help you.
oh, not the comforter, it's too hot.
- if you need anything else...
- i want a good night kiss from angie.
hand me my book, honey.
- take care of angie, cam.
yeah, and you were n't there, i'm telling you.
do n't be so dramatic.
you sound like your mom.
i swear, i heard something coming up, like from under the bed.
that's what you get for smoking this.
i've been a bit preoccupied around here.
god, you're making excuses again.
- look, i told you i'd think about it.
- this is our future, cameron.
- i know, megan.
- you graduated a year ago.
you wanna end up like your uncle, or your mom?
come on, how long are you gonna wait to start your own life?
- what, cam, what the hell?
oh, you know you need to be in bed.
i'm not doing this right now.
angie, come on. get out of there!
you should've seen the look in angie's eyes.
do you have any idea how insane that sounds?
i mean, seriously, you probably just smoked something that you should n't have.
okay, can we talk about your hallucinations later please?
angie's gonna be just fine.
the doctor said that i just need you to watch her, okay?
i know you're in there.
- come on. i gotta talk to you.
please. it's my niece.
- i have nothing to say to you.
- no, help me, please.
listen, whatever the reason is you hate me, do n't take it out on my niece.
she's just a little girl.
all you need to know, is in here.
- they were chosen, so that a child could be saved.
their deaths were wasted, they always are.
she dares you to try, but she knows. you will fail.
who are you talking about?
she's the child - stealer, her name is lilith.
she was adam's first wife.
what do you mean, adam and eve, adam?
her womb was cursed.
she would never bear children.
so what are you telling me is that lilith has angie?
- there's still time to save her.
you need to offer six other lives to lilith in little angie's place, six lives from her bloodline, from your family.
what do you want me to do?
are you expecting me to kill them?
lilith does the taking.
you have six days to mark six members of the blood line.
and if you fail, angie will be gone.
- where is your baby?
- i almost saved him.
and then you showed up.
- you let my ex-husband escape.
- he would've been the last.
- i wish you were dead, and not my boy.
but i ca n't stand the thought of that little girl going through the same thing.
i spent three days trying to understand this. i wasted time on doctors, pis, paranormal experts.
everything i could think of to save my baby.
three of my six days, and now he is gone.
you do n't have time.
- i'm not the one who needs help right now.
if i were to choose six people...
- how would i choose'em?
- the first one is unbearable.
and then it gets harder.
yeah, mom, i'm here.
no, angie has just run into fever.
it's nothing too serious.
yes, mom, i called dr. mendez.
she's in bed already.
she took her pill.
okay, so what does this book mean?
and where is nanny, cameron?
why wo n't you believe me?
you need to trust me on this one.
okay, so, lilith is a demon and you sacrificed nanny to her?
- i'm not lying, caitlin.
caitlin, it wo n't open!
i need a drink.
caitlin, that's not gonna fix anything.
what we need is five more people, and we only have four days to go.
okay, well, how do we choose?
whatever, man, just take it.
i just want you to know, uh, i hope angie's okay.
i checked on her earlier, she did n't look too good.
you checked on her?
yeah, i do care, okay?
i mean, we are family, right?
i guess we are.
- did you check on nanny?
she said she'd be back soon.
- where did you come from?
why are you sleeping?
it's been such a long week.
but you do n't have time to sleep.
hey, hey, cam, cam, wake up!
- so how do we do this?
- i need to see this.
what the... huh?
he was just lying there, and he just woke up.
- you still had time to make the symbol.
- he was awake, caitlin.
i do n't see you volunteering to cut your finger - and eternally damn your family members.
i'm not gonna lose angie, cam.
since when do you care about angie?
or did n't you think i would notice?
wait, i forgot, it's not your fault.
okay, you have a daughter who loves and adores you.
when angie needs you the most, you're walking out.
you know maybe mom was right.
maybe you do n't deserve angie.
but you are the one that brought this thing on angie.
you are the one who put her life in danger.
you are the one who's gonna take care of it.
- that's your reaction?
i'm sorry to inconvenience you, but we have some decisions here.
- i ca n't do this right now, megan.
- what can be more important than this?
look, i know you do n't wanna sacrifice your life for a kid.
megan, you told me you were on the pill.
it does n't always work.
it's life and death.
it's not an easy choice.
i wanna keep it.
i ca n't do this right now.
i just need some time.
you missed a button right here.
you're looking sharp today, grandpa.
granddad, you must be wondering where nanny is.
i really wish you were here to help me.
- can i help you?
but i can help you, cameron.
lilith... she's here.
what do you know about lilith?
she took my little girl.
sacrifice anyone, no.
i went through six days of hell not knowing. i had a way, a chance.
lilith was haunting me, mocking me, the whole time.
that's what she does.
then i became a nun.
- how did you find us?
the book sabrina gave you, i wrote it.
i've been tracking her for years.
helping anyone i can.
trying to find a way to banish the unholy beast back to hell.
have you managed to offer her anyone?
so she was pretty much already dying when i found her.
or maybe you do have some stones after all.
but three days down, you're gonna have to push harder.
a nun is encouraging me to kill my own family?
all of us are marked by years. by bad habits.
mediocre deaths and the ease of it come into our petty lives.
greatness can be written there.
that still makes me a killer.
- aunt jean, randy.
- i thought you guys were coming tomorrow.
hosting a women's luncheon, last minute, now tomorrow, so... as promised to your mother, i'm checking in.
is this a bad time?
no, no, well, maybe a little bit.
where's your grandmother, upstairs?
- she's out.
not gonna ask about my brother, but what about little angie?
she's sick and she's in bed.
it's just the cold.
- i am so susceptible to colds.
- would you guys like something to drink?
orange juice, some warm milk?
uncle joey has beer.
if your mom would've married into money like mine did, you might better off, but my mom's a total milf, so.
i do n't wanna think of aunt jean like that.
oh, come on, your mom is totally doable.
so must be tough getting laid living in your grandma's house.
well, i have a girlfriend, so, not really.
- yeah, give me a minute.
- i'm in angie's room.
hide your drugs in angie's room?
look, man, it's nothing personal.
you know, opportunity's knock and what not, so.
if you jump out at me and scare me i will pepper spray both of you.
i swear to god, guys, one more time and i'm gonna kill you.
jesus christ, cameron! are you trying to give me a heart attack?
- aunt jean's dead.
- caitlin, i ca n't do this alone.
randy's tied up in the cellar.
she did n't take him.
i should start figuring out how to do uncle joey.
you'll be with nanny.
you'll be happier.
jesus, what am i doing.
you're doing what's necessary to save angie.
your guilt is the only thing that's stopping you from saving her!
he'll understand, you know.
- you have to.
that's easy for you to say.
you do n't have to choose six people over one little girl.
do n't ever tell me what i would or would not do to save my rebeca.
and you're a fool.
a fool who's squandering the only chance you're ever gonna get.
there is no good option here.
even god knows what you have to do.
there's no going back.
so snap out of it, grow some balls and do what you have to do.
i know he's old.
and sick, and he probably does n't have much time left, but... he's still a good ma... a good man.
do n't bother screaming, nobody's here.
here, i bought you this, it's a protein shake.
what you saw upstairs was a demon taking your mom.
no, man, i totally understand.
if you let me go i can help.
sorry, i ca n't do that.
all right, and my mom, she's important, she's got stuff going on like every minute.
you do n't think people are gonna notice?
you never shut up, do you?
angie, angie, you're up?
angie, what are you doing?
- can i go see her?
i'll go check on grandpa.
i did n't think you cared.
well, that much i mean.
well, nanny will be back from aunt jean's tomorrow.
you know aunt jean.
- ah, bet gone bad.
you're family, it means something.
this is insane, we ca n't just page through our family photo albums and figure out who should die.
- and what about granddad?
granddad is gonna be a natural choice.
but he has to go after uncle joey.
or else uncle joey is gonna be way too suspicious, and i'm running out of excuses on why people are n't around anymore.
i really do n't think you need to worry about uncle joey,
i do n't know what's been going on lately... but he's a lot more...
which is kinda messed up because... it sure would be a lot easier if i still thought he was a useless asshole.
okay, yeah, dad's already on the list, but he's out of town, and i do n't have time to track him down.
okay, what about his kids?
they're blood related to angie.
i'm not killing kids.
then who are the last two, cameron?
i think we got a problem.
he thinks that angie is gonna be taken by some demon.
he tried to kill me.
- get me out!
- over here, dumbass!
- over here, caitlin.
we ca n't just leave him tied up down here.
- okay, well, we are until this is all over.
- he almost got away already.
cameron, i have a really big problem with this.
caitlin, i'm doing what i have to do to save your daughter.
- where is everybody, mom?
- you're home early.
- wait, what is this.
- no, you're not fine.
- no, come here!
honey, what's the matter?
if you had to choose between angie and caitlin, one of'em had to die, who would you choose?
- what kind of question is that?
is there something wrong with angie?
this sounds crazy, cameron.
i do n't understand any of this.
what have you been doing?
mom, listen to me.
i made some awful choices, but it's because i had to.
- this is all to save angie.
- wait, what choices are you talking about?
what have you done?
save angie from what, cameron?
what've you been doing?
cameron, what are you doing?
the devil has come to this house.
this is my fault.
i knew that i'd be called to the gates of hell one day for what i did.
what are you talking about?
when the twins were born jamie came out with all those problems, he was so sick.
he went so peacefully.
what did you do to jamie?
i took his frail life away with these evil hands.
- you killed my baby?
get away from me.
get away from me!
for three years you've had angie because i was called an unfit mother.
and you kicked me out of my home, and you would n't call me, you took my children, and you killed my jamie!
i made the wrong choice, i'm so sorry.
that was n't your choice to make.
wild cats and hyenas will meet there, and billy goats called to each other,
lilith the night monster will lurk there and find herself a place to rest.
nanny gave this to me.
i want you to have it.
- randy's tied up in the cellar.
i tried the symbol on him, it did n't work.
we gotta go right now.
i love you so much, cameron.
i want you to know i always loved you.
take care of angie.
we have our last sacrifice.
oh, my god, angie.
cam, what happened to you?
- i need something from you.
i wanna be a good father.
and i do n't wanna keep this baby.
- what the hell is going on?
let me go, please let me go!
- this is n't my baby, is it?
come on, honey,
- you guys are crazy.
- you have no idea what you've done.
i promised mom we'd finish this.
we are finishing this.
- should do the same?
she is your daughter!
i am her mother.
you're a murderer.
oh, i can take care of angie better than any murderer!
- you ca n't even take care of yourself.
you're gonna be put away, what are you gonna do for her?
they'll find her a decent home.
one with a mom who is n't shooting up.
baby, come here.
what makes you think... that you deserve to live and she deserves to die?
i'm still here, and i have a right to fight for my life.
- i do n't feel good, mommy.
help me draw the symbol on myself.
there is no time, come over here.
help me draw the symbol on myself.
tell me, promise me, caitlin.
caitlin, caitlin, go!
ready to go, sweetie?
so now the plan is either find ourselves a new counselor, stick it out with the old one, but go more often, or resign ourselves to the fact that she's never gonna be happy... no matter what i do, so let's take the money we're wasting and put it towards a membership at lakeview.
i'm guessing the last option has yet to be formally presented.
you usually run half speed to stay with me.
how are things with elyse?
you're either out of breath, or you're lying to me.
yeah. we have our moments, but they usually work out.
man, you got some water?
so how do you work things out?
i do n't know. we talk, someone apologizes.
man, i should n't have drank last night.
- hey, you mean you apologize.
you do it this morning?
maybe that's why you ca n't stand up, huh?
sleeping beauty, wake up.
come on. it's almost 4:00.
tell him i'm not feeling well.
it's saturday. you have n't been to work in three days.
just let me sleep.
you have n't been out of bed since wednesday.
no. leave me alone.
i think there's something wrong with me.
she's been averaging 18 hours of sleep a day since her admission.
every time i'm around one of them, i get blue.
it's not clinical depression.
great. got it all figured out.
you do n't need me.
three e.r. doctors, two neurologists and a radiologist have all figured out what it's not.
we need to figure out what it is.
if any of the above - mentioned doctors... were interested in my opinion, they would have asked for it.
none of them are willing to subject themselves to you.
no pain, no gain.
the blood work shows no signs of inflammation, and no one can figure out what's actually the cause -- ah.
i did n't realize it was possible for a woman to be unusually irritable.
nice try, but you're a misanthrope, not a misogynist.
what's the first thing you ask a doctor who's referring a patient?
are you questioning my ability to take a history?
what's the primary -- not "what." "why?".
diseases do n't have motives.
give me the chart.
i find your interest interesting.
she's irritable and sleeping 18 hours a day.
what's interesting about that?
hypersomnia's usually accompanied by irritability in depressed patients.
true, but not relevant.
she's sleeping 18 hours a day.
clinical depression does not cause fever.
- she could be sick and depressed.
- she's sick.
why did n't i think of that?
- yeah, that's what i meant.
hypersomnia and personality changes point toward the brain.
could this be a brain problem?
but the patient's never been outside of the united states -- especially the tropics.
- you mean she claims she's never been outside the u.s.
blood and c.s.f. smears show no sign of parasites.
- a tumor sitting directly on top of the brain stem... that three e.r. doctors, two neurologists and a radiologist missed?
redo the blood work, and get a new m.r.i. with two - millimeter cuts through the mesodiencephalic.
and check for evil stepmothers.
this much sleep usually indicates poison apples.
anything else besides the shortness of breath?
- eight hours a day.
- i teach preschool.
any history of heart disease in your family?
been under a lot of stress lately?
no more than usual.
you're probably just a little anemic.
do i need to take this off?
you can just pull that down in front.
- are those real?
- do they look real?
they look pretty damn good.
they were a present for my husband's 40th.
but i'm afraid the cause of your problem could be staring us right in the face.
actually, i guess i'm the one doing the staring.
ofcourse, i ca n't be sure.
i'd like to consult a colleague.
he's actually somewhat of an expert in these matters.
can i get a page on dr. wilson?
- we're checking just to be safe.
- y'all already checked for that.
some tumors are almost impossible to see unless you know exactly where to look.
- that means it would be small, right?
then you'd be able to operate, take it out?
if it's a tumor, there are a variety of treatment options, but there are variables other than just size.
try to remain as still as possible.
the less distortion there is, the more detail we'll be able to see.
well. that's what breasts look like.
is a lie a lie if everybody knows it's a lie?
well, if a tree pretends to fall in a forest -- house, come on.
they're a birthday present, not a philosophical treatise.
she did not do that for her husband. she did that for herself.
she thinks if she looks different, she'll be more attractive, which i have to say --
not to her husband.
cosmetic surgery is so everyone else will look at us differently.
the same reason you're wearing that tie.
that was gonna be my next point.
last three months, same five ties.
thursday should be that paisley thing.
it's a gift from my wife.
no, it's not.
you bought that yourself.
you want to look pretty at work.
wilson's got a girlfriend.
it takes two department heads to treat shortness of breath?
i want an e.k.g. and blood tests, including tox screen on mrs. --
- exam room one.
- you're ordering tests to cover your lechery.
- very tricky case.
there were no lesions and no mass effect that we could see.
it means we're still not sure what's causing the neurological problems.
i know some things are hard to cure, but what i just do n't get is why it's taking so long to figure out what's wrong with her.
- i know you're scared. i would be too.
- i do n't feel good.
honey, are you all right?
get her on her side.
- i need some ativan!
- she's having a seizure.
come on, elyse.
that we were able to detect. - it's not a tumor.
a small glioma could hide from contrast.
we could do a petscan.
that's how a responsible doctor would waste his time in this situation.
suddenly tests and radiologists are incapable of error?
a glioma not presenting on a contrast m.r.i. would have to be smaller than a grain of sand, which does not a gravely ill person make.
- it could be just postictal disorientation.
- we would have seen improvement by now.
- late - stage lyme disease can cause seizures.
- does the husband care about her?
- he has n't left her bedside.
it also means she does n't have lyme disease.
what, love conquers all?
lyme disease initially presents with a rash.
- we've looked at everything else.
did you look at her breasts?
it could be paraneoplastic.
she have any family history of breast cancer?
her mother died of it.
the brain, but not the brain.
how can breast cancer cause problems in her brain?
there are molecular similarities between brain cells and tumor cells.
paraneoplastic syndrome causes the body's own antibodies to get thrown off track.
they end up attacking the brain instead of the tumor.
so, if you do find a tumor, what do you do?
we treat the underlying malignancy.
once there's no tumor to attack, there's nothing for the antibodies to get confused about.
- if the tumor's treatable.
i'm sorry. i know it's uncomfortable.
at least it'll keep me awake.
i wish people would stop telling me not to worry.
my mom was the same age.
we've been trying to get pregnant for over a year.
guess we're lucky we did n't.
a lot has changed since your mom died.
the m.r.i. and the mammogram only showed a few benign calcifications.
it's most likely a small - cell tumor.
it's no surprise we're having trouble finding it.
we should do a pet scan.
start with her lungs, then maybe her bones.
sometimes it presents with no tumor at all.
- how can a disease caused by a tumor present if there's no tumor?
- it happens -- 12 of cases.
- and how do you treat it if there's no tumor?
those 12, no treatment.
they were too busy looking for the tumor -- right till they put the patient in the ground.
- what choice do we have?
- treat the symptoms.
- so we're just gonna ignore the tumor?
well, eventually it'll get bigger.
then it'll be really easy to find.
- one of you needs to check out where she works.
- 'cause the husband's not sick.
if it's not paraneoplastic, and it is a reaction to some sort of toxin, it's obviously not coming from their home.
foreman, you do it.
why are you riding me?
it's what i do.
yeah. seems to me.
well, that rules out the race thing.
cause you were just as black last week.
how long has elyse worked here?
the rôtisseur prepares the roasted meats and gravies.
how do you clean your grill?
you say "elbow grease".
do you use chemical cleaners?
and chefs do n't do the cleaning anyway.
you must spray for roaches and that sort of thing.
my kitchen is clean.
i need to get back to work.
so the fact that i'm here asking you these questions, it does n't worry you?
look at me. i'm here 18 hours a day.
i use the same detergents for 15 years, and everyone is healthy as a horse.
whatever elyse has, she did n't get here.
and i had to get a new rôtisseur.
i told him i'd stay up here in case you woke up.
you must have better things to do.
- you're not married?
waiting for the perfect guy?
you've already found him.
he threw my towels out the window.
that's how we met.
freshman year, ed came to a party that my roommate and i threw.
he spent most of the night on the bathroom floor.
he figured i would n't notice the vomit on the towels if i did n't have any towels.
i'm assuming he came back the next day to apologize?
i had to track him down.
conflict resolution has never been one of ed's strong points.
nobody's perfect, right?
oh, my neck hurts.
you've been in this bed for a really long time.
we're gonna do the same test we did last night, okay?
do you know what day it is?
it's probably a mild skin irritation.
- do you know what day it is?
how about i get you that cream right now?
get'em off of me!
- get'em off me!
get'em off me!
- elyse, calm down.
- get them off me!
- elyse, calm down. calm down.
they're biting me!
i'm gonna need some haldol, five milligrams.
- honey, what's wrong?
- get'em off!
there's nothing there, elyse.
they're biting me.
you gave sedatives to a patient who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?
it was better than letting her scratch all the skin off her arms.
- creepy - crawlies are consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome.
there is a simple explanation.
maybe she really has bugs under her skin.
- that's what a worsening of symptoms after immunotherapy would suggest.
blood cultures and the timeline rule out most bacteria.
patient throws up on your shoes, do you clean up most of it?
the symptoms rule out the rest.
serology rules out viruses.
c.s.f. smears rule out parasites.
in the final stage of african trypanosomiasis almost all the parasites are inside the brain.
it's possible they would n't show on smears.
but it's not possible for a patient who's never been to africa to have african sleeping sickness.
- i'm just saying it fits the symptoms.
- she could've got it from a transfusion.
- which she never had.
no, the kitchen she works in is cleaner than some hospitals.
but they do serve rabbit.
tularemia initially presents with a rash or ulcer near the infection site.
not if she inhaled it.
chopping the meat with the cleaver could easily aerosolize the bacteria.
then she'd have respiratory symptoms.
- maybe she ignored it, figured she had a cold.
we rejected lyme disease because the couple would have noticed a rash, but a wet, hacking cough is just gonna slip right by?
okay, two lousy ideas.
unfortunately, they're better than all the other ideas.
that's why i ride you.
stay tuned -- did he just turn on the tv?
he needs to think.
so this should tell us whether or not she's got rabbit fever?
for a diagnosis of tularemia you need a fourfold increase in serum antibody levels.
to measure an increase you need a before.
- a single titer over 160 would be a big clue.
- "that's why i ride you".
when i have a good idea it's because of him?
actually, i think he said your idea was a lousy idea.
i say we take our best guess and start treatment. or treat both.
the treatment for tularemia can cause aplastic anemia.
- how come he does n't ride you guys?
- got a crush on you.
- he just does n't know how to show it.
- get over it. he rides everybody.
- the treatment for sleeping sickness kills one in 10 patients.
- we start with the safer treatment.
by "safer", you mean the one that's slightly less likely to kill her.
foreman got the gang testing for tularemia?
- probably inconclusive, but worth doing.
so, what's her name?
when do i get to meet her?
- there's nobody.
- your lips say no.
well, they're french.
- you ca n't trust a word they say.
- solid, yet stylish.
a professional woman would be impressed.
i'm thinking accountant.
it's somebody in the hospital.
chemo's not sexy.
she would certainly have the neediness you need.
i'm not gonna date a patient's daughter.
ofcourse, most married men would say they do n't date at all.
there was no date.
it's her first time in an oncology unit. she's having a tough time -- emotionally.
- i wanted to be nice.
you always do. it's part of your charm.
mrs. campbell's test results.
the preschool teacher with the heart of silicone.
does n't ring a bell.
they came in yesterday.
i figured you guys would have been all over them.
i know how concerned you were.
she's all upset 'cause we paid more attention to the other girl.
you check out her ass. i've got the chest.
ofcourse, that's just my opinion.
you might wanna call a couple of guys from maintenance in for a consult.
you check her e.k.g. results before she left the other day?
- you ordered it.
- you're the responsible one.
they look normal to me.
do i have to get rid of the implants?
but your e.k.g. shows a slightly decreased heart rate.
you told me you had n't changed your diet or exercise.
does your husband have high blood pressure?
yeah, you see, if you're gonna repeat everything i say, this conversation's gonna take twice as long.
yes. he was diagnosed six months ago.
he do a lot of cooking?
not really, other than oatmeal in the morning.
did you happen to notice a slightly odd taste to the oatmeal lately?
are you saying that -- that it looks like your husband... stirred in some of his blood pressure medication along with the brown sugar.
you think my husband's trying to poison me?
i'm guessing he figured if you're both frigid, no harm, no foul.
but if you're still concerned about the shortness of breath, i'd start making your own breakfast.
if you care about your husband at all, i'd do the responsible thing.
buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find --
no. but too bad.
luckily, i have the answer.
- thanks for asking.
to life itself: sex.
- it's not without precedent.
a portuguese man was diagnosed three years ago with c.n.s. - affected sleeping sickness.
his only connection with africa was through a girlfriend who'd served with the military in angola.
where'd you find that?
the journal of the instituto de higiene e medicina tropical.
- you do n't read portuguese?
pretty sure that's what it said.
either that or it was an ad for sunglasses.
her husband has never been to africa either.
oh, stymied again.
they're completely devoted to each other.
they love each other.
they're overcompensating for guilt.
- find out which it is.
- you want me to ask a man whose wife is about to die if he cheated on her?
no, i want you to be polite and let her die.
actually, i do n't want you to ask her anything.
foreman, take the husband.
chase, take the wife.
you do n't trust me to do my job?
we all formulate questions based on the answers we want to hear.
and how exactly do you reformulate "have you screwed around?"
did you know she's been trying to get pregnant?
after you got so freaked about the sick babies a while ago, ifigured that was your thing.
but you've never been prescribed folic acid, and you ca n't lose a baby if you've never been pregnant.
you pulled my medical records?
you coughed the other day. i was concerned.
so it's either, uh, sleeping sickness or this rabbit thing?
they're both fatal without treatment.
are there tests you can do?
not at this stage.
but each condition has a unique history.
we're hoping your answers to a few questions will help us.
sure. whatever you need to know.
before the sleeping problems, did you have any trouble breathing, a cough that would n't go away -- anything like that?
i've never been away from her for more than a night.
if she had breathing troubles i would've noticed.
the other condition is significantly more likely if -- if you've had an affair.
have you ever had an affair?
- i think i'd remember cheating on my wife.
you might be reluctant to admit it.
i just want to be perfectly clear.
if your wife has sleeping sickness, and we do n't treat her, she'll die.
i would never do that to ed.
they say no cheating, we cross off sleeping sickness.
okay. we go with foreman's tularemia.
start her on i.v. chloramphenicol, 25 milligrams per kilogram, four times a day.
right next to you.
you have about 20 more days of this fun.
flow rate looks good.
no rash or flushing.
do you not remember just asking?
- she fall asleep again?
in the middle of a sentence.
- patient's not responding.
elyse, wake up.
- she's unresponsive to pain.
come on, elyse.
she's in a coma.
there's only one way a tularemia patient goes into a coma... while on i.v. chloramphenicol.
the patient does n't have tularemia.
and then there was one.
patient comes in 'cause she's sleeping too much.
it takes 10 doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness.
and then there was none.
we still have the problem of explaining how a white chick from jersey who's never traveled south of d.c. has african sleeping sickness.
still have the obvious explanation.
i made it clear.
if this guy's lying about sleeping around he knows he's murdering his wife.
and waiting for you.
your wife has human african trypanosomiasis.
you mean it's not tularemia, a virus, tumor or -- or cancer?
i've never had an affair.
and i trust elyse.
which is why i need your written consent before i can legally prescribe it.
why would she lie if she knew it could kill her?
i do n't ask why patients lie.
to protect you, because she did n't think it mattered, it just seemed easier, because... that's what people do.
but if you think there's a possibility that just one time... she was n't perfect -- one weekend you're out of town, one fight where she ran to a friend, one stupid christmas party -- then you need to allow me to start treatment.
you trust your wife that much?
and special i.v. tubing.
why do we need this stuff?
because melarsoprol melts plastic.
this stuff's basically arsenic mixed with antifreeze.
what does n't kill us makes us stronger, huh?
nietzsche would n't have been so glib if he'd been prescribed melarsoprol.
"can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, blood toxicity, neural damage, cardiac arrhythmia".
they forgot to say it's gonna hurt like all hell.
she's lucky she's in a coma.
how long before we know if it's working?
it's tough to say.
it's a good sign that she has n't gotten any worse.
does she even know i'm here?
she knows you're always there for her.
if she gets better, it means she was n't always there for me.
it means she made a mistake.
part of me -- a big part of me -- ca n't handle that.
it does n't want her to get better.
does that make me a terrible person?
so you're treating her for african sleeping sickness because you do n't think it's possible for someone to be faithful in a relationship?
and you need to tell me that.
look. i am not having an affair.
i had lunch with someone i work with -- at work.
i believe you. what i do n't believe is it'll be just once.
i love my wife.
i'm sorry. i know you love your wife.
in fact, you probably love all the women you loved who were n't your wife.
you can be a real jerk sometimes, you know that?
and you're the good guy.
at least i try.
as long as you're trying to be good, you can do whatever you want.
and as long as you're not trying, you can say whatever you want.
so, between us, we can do anything.
we can rule the world.
mine's a double, senorita.
that's portuguese, you know.
i'm recalibrating the centrifuge.
it's a very sad thing.
makes me cry too.
i told the husband he was a jerk.
when i was in college, i -- i fell in love, and i got married.
at that age, the chances of marriage lasting --
it lasted six months.
thyroid cancer metastasized to his brain.
there was nothing they could do.
i was 21, and...
i watched my husband die.
but that's not the whole story.
it's a symptom, not your illness.
thyroid cancer would have been diagnosed at least a year before his death.
you knew he was dying when you married him.
it must have been when you first met him.
you ca n't be that good a person and well - adjusted.
her fever spiked at 104.
barely 90 over 40.
did you give her dopamine?
started 270 micrograms per minute 10 minutes ago.
killing the parasites is n't gonna do much good if we kill her heart at the same time.
right now we're killing both.
if she's gonna die, we should at least let her do it without that acid flowing through her veins.
we would've expected your wife's condition to show some improvement by now.
it's going the other way.
what are you gonna do?
were you always honest with her?
do you know how lucky you are?
you ca n't love a person and do that to them.
i need to know who you had the affair with.
why did you lie to us?
you knew your life was at stake.
he's not coming back, is he?
we all make mistakes, and we all pay a price.
i need that name.
do you know where your dad is?
this town was my home once.
go far away and never come back.
every werewolf will be a bundle of fur and sharp teeth tonight whilst your cursed crescent clan will be... human but only for a few hours and wo n't be again until the next full moon.
you're the wolf who's been watching me.
you were supposed to be my wife.
it's herbs ground into paste.
on the next full moon when your people become human, feed it to them.
the curse will be broken.
i've been hexed, and i do n't know how long i have.
the ancestors said they'd do horrible things to me if i misused my magic again.
marcellus, you are here by exiled.
if i so much as find a trace of you, it will not end well for you.
nicely done, brother.
you're beginning to sound like me.
they say the passage of time will heal all wounds...
but the greater the loss, the deeper the cut... and the more difficult the process to become whole again.
the pain may fade, but scars serve as a reminder of our suffering and make the bearer all the more resolved never to be wounded again.
so as time moves along, we get lost in distractions, act out in frustration...
give in to anger.
all the while, we plot and plan as we wait to grow stronger.
then before we even realize that so much time has passed...
we are healed, ready to begin anew.
spoken like a man who's made peace with his demons.
my demons are dead or chased off.
i trust you can find your clothing and the door.
you do recall that... woman tortured our sister?
she also revealed the truth about our sister's treachery.
and as a consequence, rebekah is gone forever.
a desire which she apparently harbored for quite some time!
niklaus, it has been a month.
now i feel our sister's loss as deeply as you, but you must stop distracting yourself with this ridiculous behavior and channel it into some kind of action.
why must i exactly?
because over the course of marcel's tenure, the city grew accustomed to having a king.
you wanted this throne.
now you must accept the responsibility that accompanies that.
apologies, but i'm rather ensconced in other pursuits.
if you can so easily neglect your home, i wonder what will become of your daughter.
have you forgotten what it was like to live beneath the threat of violence?
we must work together, niklaus.
let's make this city whole again.
perhaps it is too broken to mend.
st. anne's has long been neutral ground in our city, so it's only fitting that we gather in this chamber at the behest of elijah mikaelson to bring harmony to this place we call home.
thank you all for coming.
yes, thank you, and welcome.
you said if we came along that we would get to run things by ourselves.
while you were each selected to represent your own communities, and i'll honor that.
however, issues which arise between factions, they will come to me.
now we are all to some extent responsible for the current chaos in the city.
however, you have one very, very simple choice ahead of you here.
you can all play nicely together, or you can leave.
all you have to do is try.
trying and failing ever since you came back.
when you stop being weak.
you're supposed to be a harvest girl, but maybe you do n't belong here.
should n't you be out there playing fight club with the rest of the frat boys?
that's just for pecking order.
they already know who's the alpha.
you got to try tucker's ribs.
then we're gonna go play horseshoes?
do n't mock country living, darling.
this is just a lot more family fun than i'm used to.
well, maybe i can help you get used to it.
then all we got to do is just forget that she spent half her life with humans and the other half with vampires.
ollie, back off.
if the runt of the litter has got something to say, he should say it.
you know, word from the quarter is your boy elijah's holding some kind of power summit.
guess who was n't invited.
where did you hear this?
the point is is that we're stuck here living in the swamp while your vampire boyfriend's deciding who gets what in the city, but i guess that shows how much respect he's got for the werewolves, huh?
this is our city, too.
we're getting nowhere.
you vile creatures can not agree...
father, calm yourself, please.
now returning to the issue of boundaries, you will all heed to the following.
you're dividing up the city, and the werewolves do n't even get a say?
what the hell is she doing here?
we are not dividing the city.
we're establishing boundaries...
there is not gonna be a peace if the werewolves are excluded.
they want a seat at the table...
and if they do n't get one, i can guarantee that you will all regret it.
no, actually, i do n't because i did n't even know what you were doing out here until someone else told me.
tell me something, elijah.
did you leave the werewolves out because of me?
i excluded them because they no longer reside in the french quarter.
my immediate concern is to end the mounting conflict here.
now i can assure you once this treaty is solidified it will expand to include your people.
and until then, i should tell them what?
sit, stay, roll over?
i would prefer that you remove yourself from the process altogether.
hayley, are you absolutely certain that you should n't return to the compound?
you think that's where she'll be safe?
is the bayou any better?
the wolves deserve a voice.
you know it's the right thing to do.
you should have seen your brother's face when hayley walked in.
do you believe this will actually work, that we can finally have some semblance of peace in this city?
i saw the light from the courtyard and took a chance that... you were n't with a half - naked psychowitch.
seems i gambled and lost.
10 minutes ago, i was fully naked.
then you served your purpose.
do n't let me hold you up.
the woman tried to blackmail me into stabbing you with the mystical knife of excruciating pain.
well, new orleans breeds nothing if not strange bedfellows, but i assume you're not here to question me on my leisure activities.
he's... deteriorating.
the pills, the meditation, they're not working.
his lucidity's shrinking by the day.
a witch did this, a witch can undo it.
you seem supertight with genevieve.
maybe you could persuade her to help.
it wo n't do any good.
these hexes, they start with magic, but as they take root, they alter the very chemistry of the brain.
i'm sorry, cami.
the damage is done.
i refuse to accept that, and you would, too, if you had any concept of family.
davina, what are you doing out here?
i would have met you anywhere you wanted.
i mean, not anywhere klaus or marcel would be, which could be pretty much, you know, anywhere, but you know what i mean.
she has no idea what i went through when i was dead.
i ca n't just start practicing again.
i knew i should n't have trusted marcel when he told me to go back.
i do n't know how much more of it i can take.
on the outs with the witch again?
i got it covered.
what was so important you dragged me all the way out here?
i have a proposal.
i want you and all the guys who walked out on klaus with you to join me.
rounding up an army?
ca n't take back the city without one.
you have no weapons, no allies.
you go even close to the quarter, and elijah will kill you.
that's if klaus does n't get you first.
so, what, maybe i should hide out in bucktown like you?
i think you're here because you do n't want to leave your home.
a battle is brewing, t, and while everyone's busy choosing sides, i'm gonna find a way to take back our city, so...
you were always great with words, marcel, but it's gonna take more than a big speech this time.
is that really necessary?
the sickness, it's overtaking my inclination to forgive, replacing it with one thought that i could barely contain at the summit
"kill every last one of them."
i tried to figure it out with sean, but i was focused too much on that instead of trying to stop him, and i'm not... i'm not gonna let that happen to me.
you're an o'connell.
they are going to ask you to take my place at the table.
how many times do i have to tell you i ca n't be fixed?
and how many times do i have to tell you i will not stop trying?
like when you were a little girl.
you always had to be right.
you... you... you never listened.
just that thick head of yours.
i prayed for you.
and i got no answer.
there is only blackness.
there is only death.
please call me francesca.
you own the palace royale casino, you're one of the city's leading philanthropists, and according to my sources, you're the matriarch to a rather sizeable drug trafficking empire.
so why am i here?
whatever you may think of me, my family's been a part of the human faction for years, which makes me uniquely qualified to take father kieran's place.
you'll deal with me from now on.
are you giving me a mandate?
i'm giving you an ally.
i want peace just as much as you do.
my lifestyle, which i enjoy very much, depends on it.
yes, i can see you're highly motivated.
you know, i should mention, i've already spoken to the city's new mayor and the chief of police and other... interested parties, and i have their blessing.
i think you'll find it beneficial to have me on your side, even if it's just to prevent my less civil brethren from lashing out in ways that could prove painful to you.
not a fan of cerulean blue?
not a fan of your continued indifference.
well, it's difficult trying to unite a community that has a history of mutual loathing.
spare me the platitudes, niklaus.
if you want peace, you must begin with the werewolves.
100 years ago, they had a run at ruling this city.
as of late, all they've had is time to watch their enemies tear down that legacy.
all the more reason why their enemies are reluctant to bring them to the table.
take a page from bienville, brother.
if the table's the obstacle, remove it.
do you recall in 1720 the governor's desperation to secure our help to build the cities first levees?
we sat with him and refused his offer, and so he plied us with wine, with corseted women, and with raucous camaraderie until he had his yes.
are you suggesting that i throw a party?
i'm impressed, brother.
now if i can just keep them from tearing one another to shreds.
well, then for your sake, here's to a spectacularly boring evening.
what's up, little man?
he's not even worth it.
since you're preoccupied, i'll intuit your flattering compliment.
i think i look stunning, too.
i trust you've spent as much time fortifying alliances as you clearly have selecting that dress.
so you do notice me.
and, yes, i've already settled the dispute over the docks, i pacified the witches with an increased share in cemetery tours, and i've given the crescents a welcome back to humanity gift in the form of 100 chips to my casino.
so i think i deserve some champagne, do n't you?
you know, in light of kieran's deteriorating condition, the others have acquiesced to your proposal.
you will represent the human faction until he's ready to resume.
then i suggest we make the most of our limited time together.
if you expect me to beg for my life, that's not me anymore.
you think i'm here to kill you?
i'm here about davina.
if it falls apart, each faction's gonna look for leverage against the other ones.
davina has to be able to defend herself, even from her own people if need be.
she has to start doing magic again.
because someone has to tell her, and she wo n't listen to me.
so, what, i tell her, and you try to get her back on your side, right, go back to using her as your personal weapon?
i do n't care whose side she ends up on, just that she's safe because we both know right now she is n't.
you will be polite and welcoming.
see, his people killed my whole family.
my sister bled out on the floor right next to me.
i can not be polite and welcoming to that.
diego, i understand your anger.
however, there are certain overtures that need to be made if we are to find a degree of peace.
welcome to my home.
i would n't be here if hayley had n't forced the issue.
it's rather unlikely that you'll experience an outpouring of kind sentiment here.
the vampires in particular view you as... well, barbaric.
hayley tells me that this peace treaty is important to you.
yes, it certainly is.
so much so, in fact, that if anyone threatened to dismantle what i'm building here, i'd destroy everything they hold dear.
have a wonderful evening.
do n't tell me you're jealous of cami, luv.
she seems so... ordinary.
well, sometimes, ordinary is a welcome respite.
i'm so glad you accepted my invitation.
so is this where the great klaus mikaelson says something poignant and snaps my neck?
i'm not here to kill you.
i'm here to offer you a gift.
out of the kindness of your vampire heart?
you see, long before i evolved, mine beat as a werewolf.
i know your power.
i know your burden.
i'm here to take the latter away.
you want to make me a hybrid.
i put my pack first, and i'm not gonna let anything compromise my family line, especially becoming some bloodthirsty vampire parasite.
that pride... that sense of loyalty, well, that's exactly why i have n't snapped your neck yet.
well, if you're not gonna kill me, then what the hell do you want?
only to give you back the city that was taken from you.
how was that for poignant?
why would i trust someone who's conspiring behind his own brother's back?
i'm not trying to undermine elijah's venture.
vampires destroy life to survive, witches are only as powerful as their dead, but the werewolves have thrived because their strength comes from family unity.
the safety of that unity is what i want for my unborn child.
the painful truth is vampires are the antithesis of unity.
so, what, after a thousand years, you're finally ready to embrace the other half of your family tree?
maybe the other half does n't want you.
oh, they will once they return to the quarter.
you got a plan to back that up?
my mother was a very powerful witch.
i watched her craft all manner of magical items, but her most prized possession was this ring.
i had n't seen it for 1,000 years, and then it turned up hanging around the neck of a werewolf, a direct descendant of my biological father.
i believe she gave him this ring as a way of freeing him.
daylight rings shield vampires from the sun, so why not a moonlight ring to protect werewolves from the curse?
no more breaking bones, no more losing control to the beast within.
nervous, out of place, short in this dress?
i was gonna say pretty.
so what's the name of the girl i'm about to ask to dance?
her name is monique.
would you care to dance?
you even got klaus to come out and play.
it seems that only a sizeable soiree is enough to tear my brother away from his efforts at the easel.
that's never a good sign.
klaus once told me that his painting was a metaphor for control, for achieving his vision through sheer force of will.
well, trustfully, i'd be shocked if he did n't have at least a dozen or so of those visions swarming around in that insidious skull of his.
it is weird being back here.
not unpleasant i hope.
are you entirely sure you should n't be here with us?
because you do n't think it's safe in big, bad wolf country?
you can have it later.
actually, he can have this dance.
we were just discussing the future of the city.
how can you be thinking about the city right now?
i should have told you how beautiful you look tonight.
i just saw kieran.
he's not gonna hurt you again.
in fact, he wo n't leave the attic at all.
i arranged for a little boundary spell.
you got a witch to help you?
for you, i found one who does n't.
you're the first person to help me in a month.
kieran's the only family i have left.
i'm a little short on family myself these days.
if there's anything i can do, cami, just... just let me know.
there is one thing.
we're out of bourbon.
should have had them put it in a bowl for you.
well, yeah, if you want me to crush your skull with it.
at least fight over something interesting...
you do n't want to get involved with his kind.
see, they got this nasty little habit of going berserk and ripping innocent people to shreds.
if my people wronged you in any way, you have my condolences, ok?
though i'd be surprised my kin could choke them down, being half as ugly as him.
i wo n't ask again.
what's stopping you?
go ahead, elijah.
i mean, it's not like he does n't deserve to die.
should n't you intervene or something?
this party just got interesting.
i mean, it was oliver who handed rebekah over to the witches so they could torture her, but then again, was n't it diego who led a werewolf massacre last month?
and the witches cursed the wolves, while the humans stood back and let it all happen, so when you think about it, everyone here deserves to die.
are approaching a point?
my point, elijah, is this.
if we ca n't all learn to get along, if our families ca n't create some sort of community, then what's the point?
you know, i've only gotten roses once in my life.
did n't even get to keep them.
my first boyfriend, my only boyfriend really, gave them to me for valentine's day senior year.
tried to hide them in my bedroom, but my parents found them.
you may not know it, but roses will jam even the best paper shredders.
you know, i do n't have a home to go home to or a family to go home to.
i used to hate myself for that, but the thing is, i do n't really care what they think anymore.
if your family does n't like you the way you are, screw them.
you got me and cami, even marcel if you want.
he used you to fight the people who were trying to kill you, and, you know, he also saved you from those people, so...
you do n't have to trust the guy, but he does love you.
and p.s., so do i.
even if i do n't have any magic?
all the power i had was from the other harvest girls.
i do n't even know what i have without it.
do n't you owe it to yourself to find out?
you're a witch, davina.
you ca n't change your dna any more than i can, so you might as well embrace it.
i'm still bruised.
oh! "bruise" is such a funny word.
it sounds like "booze."
do we have any more booze?
you're a good friend, marcel.
you should lie down.
i'm tired of being alone.
for whatever reason, klaus trusts me, and you're the person he probably hates most right now.
he'd see it as a betrayal.
that would n't be good for either of us.
you said i had nothing.
i have the same thing i had when i rebuilt this city from the ashes the first time...
everything to gain and nothing to lose.
i'm making inroads, allies, not the least of which is davina, and i'm not leaving this roof until i can count you in, too.
besides, let's be honest, t, i'm all you got.
i know those vampires, they did n't just leave the compound.
they left new orleans.
we'll get a third and a fourth, and pretty soon, we're gonna have that army.
passion for one's cause...
determination to overcome any obstacle...
and in some cases, even making unnatural alliances.
you made a deal with klaus mikaelson?
i'd rather turn every full moon.
if klaus is right, this magic could do more than just stop us from turning.
we could finally control what we are.
we could draw on all the strength, all the speed, the raw power of our werewolf form.
our bite would be lethal to vampires 24  7.
the humans who hunt us, the witches who curse us, the vampires who hate us, we would n't just be their equals.
we'd be their superiors.
you've already done so on our behalf.
brother, i'm not a fool.
it's clear to me you're not as disinterested as you'd like me to believe.
if there is no peace between us, then how can you expect others to follow suit?
if it will make you happy... but i assure you this city's inhabitants will not adhere to this agreement.
and why am i pretending to be dead?
so i could get away from everyone, everything that could distract me from you.
- mother, she's married.
you ca n't have other people in your life, especially women.
i need a room for a few hours.
i was sorry to hear your parole got denied.
that's all i care about.
mother, i have someone else's wallet, and i do n't know how i got it.
do you ever have the feeling that you've had the same nightmare over and over again, but that you ca n't remember it?
someone's gonna hear you.
y - you there?
those thunder bumpers have finally left the area.
it is 68 degrees and partly sunny in bend, with another chance of rain on saturday.
high pressure building... romero.
i'm here because you were worried about me.
it was really kind of you to send your friend to see how i'd been getting along.
do n't think i am unsympathetic to your plight.
i know what it's like to be locked up somewhere and being watched all the time, because you put me in such a place... do you remember?
that was your mother's decision.
that is a lie.
it... it was you.
and i'm still alive.
i'm coming for you when you least expect it, so do n't get too cozy up at that house all by yourself.
caleb decided to move on.
he said he did n't think it'd be good for him to live here, even though he'd love to be near us.
well, at least he left a note this time.
yeah, i talked to him.
what did you say?
i feel terrible... and relieved.
and... and i feel terrible that i feel relieved.
hey, it's not your fault.
you ca n't fix something that happened before you were born.
and you've done the best you possibly could with it.
it's a good path.
let's just try and stay on it.
god, i know how hard it is.
i feel the same way about my mom.
i wish katie could know her and... and caleb, but i - i just do n't think it's in anyone's best interest.
norma, are you home?
- hey. watch it.
d - do you get some coffee here, too?
it... it's right across the street.
a lot of them about preserving the architectural history of the village.
and if you hate it, you can tell me to stop.
can i set you up with someone?
i do n't really do that sort of thing, you know.
i've gotten to know this nice girl, joanne.
she's helping me with my store website.
she's single and says she never meets anyone.
i thought it would be a win-win.
and a chance for us to get to know each other better, too.
well, i think if you're going, then it's different.
- yeah. you are.
i just got caught up.
he owns the bates motel right outside the village.
what was the name?
i'm setting norman up with joanne carlson.
you know, that woman who's been totally redesigning our website?
- you met her, like, twice.
sam's head is still in seattle.
my business is there.
i'm finishing up some real estate development.
sounds exciting, sam.
why do n't we say tonight?
say, 7:00 at the temple street bar?
i would love to have dinner with you, meet your friend.
- see you later.
how do you feel?
do you know your name?
d - do you know yours?
i know that i do n't have a concussion.
i'm serving five years on a trumped - up perjury beef.
did someone find out you're a cop?
ca n't hide the truth forever.
found out i was an ex-cop and jumped me.
maybe i need to talk to my lawyer.
who are you talking to?
i'm studying french.
the bedroom is blue.
i figure just because i'm trapped in this house does n't mean my mind has to stagnate.
the cherry is red.
by the way, where have you been all day?
i was up at 7:00. you were already gone.
i just had a few errands to run.
the traitor was hung.
what kind of french course is this?
- where were you really today?
i went to see romero in prison.
to tell him that you know he sent someone to kill you and you're still alive?
- basically, yes.
- that's kind of dumb.
i mean, would n't it be better to let him think that you're dead so he leaves you alone?
mother, he is going to get out someday, and we have to deal with it.
he thinks that i killed you, remember?
i can handle him when he gets out.
are... are you saying you're gonna kill him?
mother, do you still have feelings for him?
- it's just chick.
he's so annoying.
i have to hide every time he comes over.
i know, mother, but he's been nice to me, okay?
and besides, okay, it's necessary to have one friend from the outside.
it makes things look more normal.
i just came by to check on you.
is it a bad time?
it's just an expression.
i'm here. i brought these for you.
yeah, they're lady annes.
moving out of that place.
that's actually not why i... why i came.
i wanted to show you something.
i have a business proposition for you.
let's go in the basement!
the basement it is!
it's a peregrine.
fastest - moving creature on record.
still pretty rare, though.
then i help you sell'em.
you really think someone will buy them?
you got quite a talent.
your technique is superlative.
i know an art dealer in portland who specializes in the un- commonalities.
she's showcased some of my work.
we'll do a 5050 split.
caleb crippled my hands and my body.
i ca n't work on my own.
it's working much better.
thanks for fixing it.
it's staying cold.
welcome to the kings motel.
- i'm just visiting my sister.
- cash is fine.
who's your sister?
um, when was the last time you talked to her?
like, a year and a half ago.
i've been out of the country.
she... she passed away.
it was a terrible tragedy.
i was just with her son.
i do n't know what to tell you.
look, she... she died.
it made the local news.
i'm so sorry you had to hear about it this way.
you need a room again for a few hours?
i came to see you.
i'm not sure we have the same dictionary definition.
i'm not gonna stand here and explain myself to you.
all i can tell you is... stay out of it.
it's none of my business.
i barely know you or your wife.
but man - to - man, sam, you do n't care much for her, do you?
do n't screw with me.
mother, are you smoking?
it's not like it's gonna kill me.
i can smoke if i want to.
no, you ca n't.
you ca n't smoke.
you're just trying to punish me.
is this silliness because we were talking about romero?
do you still love him?
he sent someone here to kill me.
you remember that, right?
you seem really into business meetings lately.
and i did n't even go to the last one.
just do n't get yourself in such a state, listening to this music.
- and do n't smoke.
i started in the theater department.
i wanted to be a stage actor more than anything, but i never got cast, and my dad kept telling me that no one was going to cast me and i needed another job.
he said that the last thing this world needs is another actor, and i was like, "thanks, asshole."
parents do n't always know.
we do n't talk anymore.
so, then you decided to go into computer programming.
you're amazing at it.
norman, you should see the website she's making for us.
it's easy with you.
i know she is, just from being in her shop.
yes, of course, sam.
it's just, you're never there.
well, my business is in seattle.
it was n't my idea to move, but we're getting it figured out.
and we're out.
could we get another bottle of the château de maragrite?
you have such a good french accent.
do you speak french?
i just listen to french movies sometimes.
"am i watching this or reading it?" you know?
i guess i'm more of a doer.
he made some good money from it, but he knows the market way better in seattle than the market here.
- you can handle it.
- yeah, i can.
it's all gonna be good.
my mother used to say that.
well, she was right.
she passed away not too long ago.
i'm really glad you came out tonight.
i could just as easily ask you that question.
mother, i am not the one who's supposed to be dead.
i mean, what if someone saw you in here?
by the way... when did you start lying to me?
i just got trapped into coming to this dinner.
madeleine wanted me to meet her friend.
i've got no interest in her friend, but i did n't want to be rude.
it just seemed easier to go to the dinner than insult her.
well, i'm glad you're thinking of everyone else's feelings.
mother, you're overreacting, okay?
but right now you need to leave.
we ca n't risk you walking back through the restaurant.
what's ridiculous is a dead woman walking through a restaurant where she might be spotted by any number of people who know her.
i did n't see any people i know.
just go out the window now.
i will be done with dinner soon.
just wait for me.
norman, do you still like me?
i still like you.
i can go to a circuit judge and effectively argue that your life is in jeopardy in here and that it was punitive to ever put you in a medium - security prison based on a perjury charge.
i should be able to get you to a work farm.
well, i'd like to be moved.
i have a responsibility to... to take care of the son that she left behind.
i'll file the transfer request.
- until then, just relax.
the people i was having dinner with are just a few cars away.
they might see you.
why are you having dinner with someone who looks like me?
i do n't think she looks like you.
she's like me but ten years younger.
are you gonna be one of those guys?
mother, it was just a friendly little dinner.
what are you doing?
i'm going out.
how's your night going?
i'm just sick of my job.
i'm a caretaker for a mentally ill person.
and i do n't... i do n't think he likes me that much anymore.
it makes the job a lot harder.
it's getting to me.
i need to get out more, see real people.
i'm gonna have to start cutting my hours.
i admire that you do that work.
how much do we project onto our mates?
and why the hell do we need so much anyways?
is happiness, in a sense, all just a creation of the mind?
you do n't want to mess with me right now.
you're saying that to somebody who you beat the crap out of, left for dead, stole all their money, and ruined their life.
you're forgetting about the part where you almost got me and my son killed.
do n't you dare talk about her like that, or i will kill you.
we do n't have to talk about how you raped your sister.
i do n't care if we are in public, okay?
you say her name again like that, and i will kill you.
i will kill you.
you just found out.
you have no idea about anything.
she would n't kill herself.
- you told who?
she did n't listen to me.
he's not getting away with it, no.
you're not getting away!
i know what you did!
i'm still alive.
could you use some extra help around the house?
what could you accomplish if you had someone, something like this?
if we could do it in the office on monday, we would n't be talking now!
it's the weekend here too.
can one of you get that?
yeah, the supplier wo n't...
you've reached the hawkins.
please leave a message, 'we might remember to check it in about three months' time.
why is n't mum back yet?
 you know why, her case is running over.
 soph, shoes on.
we're going shopping.
what about my lift to josh's?
that thing with wheels we got you for christmas?
just need your autograph there.
this is the best thing you'll do for your family.
plus, 30 days to return, no questions asked.
go on, dad!
what if she's not pretty?
can we change her if she's not pretty?
just follow the instructions on the tablet, and you'll have it configured in no time.
there she blows then.
your brand - new synthetic.
standard domestic profile installed.
that'll cover all your basic housework.
i'll leave you to crack on.
i'm now in set - up mode and ready for primary user bonding.
i'm the primary user.
a dna sample will be taken for identification and security purposes.
this information will never be shared with any third - party organisation.
i'm now securely bonded to you as my primary user.
right, now what do we do?
look, soph, that's a really posh one.
i like our one.
olivia green has two at her house, but they're not as cool as you.
more bumf for you.
would you like me to drive, joe?
yeah, go on then.
that's our car there.
i'm now securely bonded to you as a secondary user.
 what's its core processor speed?
 how should i know?
do n't go unscrewing her, she's expensive.
hello, you must be matilda.
pretty, is n't she, mats?
if you say so, teeny.
mum ok with this?
 it's a surprise.
it's almost dinner time.
my mum's back.
 oh, come here!
well, two out of three pleased to see me.
you must be laura.
i do n't want one around the kids!
we've had this conversation!
maybe, ages ago, but have you seen the place?
that's after having it for less than a day!
it will mess with their heads.
and we do n't need one!
 you're taking it back.
i'm not taking it back, i needed some help, so i got some.
 why did n't you tell me about it?
 you were n't here!
 so, message me, yeah?
five days, laura!
i've been looking after them, and working, like i always do, which is fine, but you do n't get to waltz back in the door and tell me what this family needs!
i had no choice, i had to stay.
call the office if you want.
what i want is to try this.
this is called the life cycle.
so first, they're in an egg that's round.
then they turn into larvae, which is a baby.
then they turn into a beautiful red ladybird.
so, have you given it a name?
we were waiting for you, mum.
i think we should call her anita.
like your friend who moved?
darling, you know that's just a machine.
it does n't have feelings.
it ca n't replace anita.
it's just a nice name.
everyone happy with anita?
it's fine by me.
your name is going to be anita.
so, um, what's your name?
my name is anita hawkins.
we've got a month to take it back.
we can talk about it then.
how the hell can we afford it?
over five years, less than we pay for the car.
we need to get off the road.
it's getting dark.
find somewhere that we ca n't be seen from the road and set up camp.
charge with what fuel we've got left, and max and me will look for some more.
would you like me to unpack your case for you, laura?
hey, i'm looking for this synth.
oh, when did you bring it in?
she was stolen... about five weeks ago.
i know you use this place as a front to move boosted units.
why, do you feel threatened?
i have never seen her.
we do n't do that no more.
give me a name!
perhaps she's been damaged!
or reprogrammed... or destroyed.
do n't say that, do n't even think that.
she's been taken by junkers, sold on somewhere, just like fred and lishka.
then why's she the only one that has n't been in contact?
is it a party?
what do you reckon, mats?
harun's parents' one does this three meals a day.
anita, brown sugar.
she's not a slave.
that's exactly what she is.
having anita does n't mean you three get to sit on your bums all day.
for god's sake, that's already clean!
the dishwasher's worked nonstop for years.
 why do n't we throw it a party?
 shut up, mats.
oh, because we ca n't guess why you like her so much, crusty sheets.
oh, enough, mattie!
i apologise, anita.
finally, someone to laugh at my jokes.
besides you, you mean.
can you not read?
yes, i can read, dr millican.
i'm lindsey kiwanuka, your case worker.
you've failed to keep any of your appointments with us.
big place to have all to yourself.
i see you have no family nearby.
"i live in that solitude that is painful in youth," but delicious in the years of maturity. "
is your synth in? wow.
you have an original d-series.
he's out grocery shopping.
but i have good news.
you qualify for an upgrade.
one of these bad boys.
can do ten times what a d - series can do.
she can fine - tune your medication, develop exercise plans to lower your risk, take your blood pressure with a finger.
not now, vera.
does she check the prostate too?
look, i'm happy with the one i've got.
and my health is just fine.
it says here you suffer memory loss and tremors in the extremities.
george - the law requires me to give your companion the once- over.
i will be back soon, and if your d-series fails the check, you get one of these whether you like it or not.
the health service has n't ordered half a million of them for fun.
we'll show ourselves out.
is it my turn now?
game's over, odi.
then would you like some toast and jam, george?
your favourite is apricot.
this is the jacket mary wore to the wedding of your nephew james.
a baby regurgitated on it.
duncan's little girl.
mary was not upset by the infant's actions.
no, she was nuts about little babies.
come on, son.
do n't want you shorting out on the toaster again.
not my boyfriend, if that's what you're getting at.
 how long you back for?
 come on, mats.
i just want to know when you're going away again.
although it was different this time.
 this time you did n't bother.
mother of the year!
that's my job - clear?
of course, laura.
i'm sorry about my case going over.
there's nothing i could do about it.
is that why you want to replace me with that thing?
it's not the working away.
i'm just... not always sure how much you want to come home.
i know you need time alone.
after you lost your mum and dad so young.
these last two years... i do n't know, lor.
i feel... avoided.
i think mats does too.
things just get on top of me.
that's why i want the synth.
to give us time.
i did n't buy anita to replace you,
i bought her to get you back.
but i have n't gone anywhere.
can you get out?
yes, i will be at the rendezvous in an hour.
it is sweltering in here.
can i help you, sir?
who's your primary user?
i am owned by leithridge farm foods limited.
i had no previous owners, sir.
they ca n't lie, or think.
now why would a synth need a telephone?
i'm not alone, fred.
so please do n't run, son.
 leo, would you like to hear a joke?
he's not coming.
 apricot.  stop it.
 i ca n't turn it off.
do n't come in, dad.
matilda, it's anita.
i'm doing a dark wash.
what's your max processing speed?
the maximum speed i have recorded is 27.39 petaflops.
if someone overclocked, you might be able to hit 30.
overclocking would risk irreparable damage to my processor cluster.
my protocol set demands i take reasonable passive measures to avoid damage, unless those measures could endanger human beings or property more valuable than myself.
let it hit you this time.
like ricochet or something.
i do n't deem that a significant risk, matilda.
i own you and i'm telling you i want it to hit you.
anita, give us a minute.
 gone from an a to d in computers?
 got harder this term.
oh, come on, that's bollocks!
we all know what an amazing mind you have.
 if you apply yourself...
i could be anything i want, right?
that would take me seven years but, by then you'll be able to turn any old synth into a brain surgeon in seconds.
we just want you to do your best.
the washing is done.
i'll be catching up on some e-mails if anyone needs me.
di karen voss, special technologies task force.
that the owner of the device?
he comes in here all the time.
take it easy on him.
dr millican, i am detective sergeant drummond.
 i deal with synthetic - related matters.
 it was an accident.
yeah, but, as you can see, a woman's been injured.
i need to see your operating licence.
you've had this one for six years.
that's a record.
why have n't they upgraded you?
i do n't want a crappy upgrade.
this machine needs to be recycled, mate.
it wo n't even power up.
i can fix him.
i mean, i can get him fixed.
someone's been hurt, so we have to get it scrapped.
 it's the law.
i'll tell you what, take him yourself, but he has to go, george.
multiple faults detected upon start - up.
odi, we're going to look at some old photos.
it's you and me.
this is you and mary.
error reading file partition.
 data may be corrupted.
right after i took this picture, she got stung by a bee on her foot.
now, release your hip.
simon, you know i'm tickly there.
 good day? bad day?
jill walked 122 steps today.
a personal best since the accident.
he thinks i'm able to start reducing the anti-inflammatories soon.
i'm going to have a soak, but he's made some chicken with mango coleslaw if you fancy.
the dragon said, "i'm sad because i want to be like you, mouse -
"small and furry and warm.
then we could fly away together. "
but the little mouse said, "dragon, if you were like me..."
i'll take over now, anita.
i want her to do it!
reading to you is mummy's job.
but she does n't rush.
it's almost time for daddy to give you your bath now.
i want her to finish!
sophie, it's time to stop now.
can i use your bubbles?
i do n't want you touching sophie.
i'm prohibited from initiating physical contact with a human without a clear, recorded request to do so.
my protocol set currently demands that any such requests from children under 12 must be referred to a parent or guardian before being met, unless i judge the child's safety or wellbeing to be at immediate risk.
you're just a stupid machine, are n't you?
 he's dead, is n't he?
what have i always told you?
never reveal my true nature in public.
does n't matter what happens to me.
if they knew what you were...  it would be the end?
for all of you.
we'll find mia.
now, be strong.
yeah, i'll have ten minutes with number seven.
 hey, big boy.
 come here, lover boy.
come on, show me a...
did n't you bring me any clothes?
niska, i'm sorry.
i ca n't get you out tonight.
fred did n't make the rendezvous.
have you had any contact from mia?
 it's been five weeks, leo.
now fred's gone, too, so i'm not staying here for a second longer.
i ca n't make you, but it is safer here.
no - one knows what you really are, but, walk out of here tonight, that changes, because this place paid a lot of money for you.
they'll report it.
that gets back to the people hunting us, and then you'd have to take your chances on the street with me.
 oh, he's not like you or fred.
he ca n't take care of himself.
he ca n't hide what he really is.
i will find a way to get you out and we'll make a new home somewhere.
 there is no home for us.
did you turn off your pain
 like i told you?
niska, what are you doing?
niska, stop it.
you have to press the button.
it needs human body heat.
just hold on a little longer.
he's far from normal.
my hope is that he'll lead us to the others.
 when do my people get to examine it?
 that wo n't be possible.
our companies have funded your operation for years.
unlimited resources, total access, all because you claim there are a handful of synthetics who can think and feel.
now you've finally found one, i think we've earned the right to study it.
robert, these machines are conscious.
how do you know they do n't simulate it?
how do i know you do n't?
a simulation would be of no interest.
his goal was to create machine life, as he called it.
oh, so they're alive now?
a parody of it, which is why they are so dangerous.
they're just freaks.
do you know what the singularity is?
a mathematician named john von neumann coined the term in the 1950s to describe the inevitable point in the future when technology surpasses us, when it becomes able to improve and reproduce itself without our help.
it is the moment we become inferior to the machine.
now, our world is on the verge of becoming dependent on synth labour.
these synths are physically no different to any others, and yet elster gave them consciousness.
if it can be done for the few, it can be done for the more.
do you think they would still want to be slaves?
these freaks are the singularity!
i ca n't let you be recycled.
is it a game?
there's things that you know.
she cried and laughed.
she cried when i pulled the bee sting out.
at the doctors, she laughed.
you laughed too, george.
and mary said i could...
would you like some toast and jam, george?
what would you say if i asked what you thought of this music?
i'd say it's very well played.
what do you base that on?
i compare the pitch, tonality and rhythm of the performance to the sheet music that i access via...
do you think anything of it?
making lasagne and talking philosophy with a bloody tin can.
those veg should be done.
i want to give anita a goodnight kiss!
i'm fully qualified in first aid -
i prioritised the risk to sophie's safety.
sophie, you silly girl, you know you're supposed to be careful around the oven.
the best reason for making machines more like people is to make people less like machines.
the woman in china who works 11 hours a day stitching footballs, the boy in bangladesh inhaling poison as he breaks up a ship for scrap, the miner in bolivia risking death every time he goes to work.
they can all be part of the past.
synthetic devices free people.
we've treated people like machines for too long.
it's time to liberate their minds, their bodies to think, to feel...
to be more human.
but a lot of people would argue that work is a human right.
if anything, the hard work gives you a sense of self worth.
i think you should spend one week working in a microchip facility.
so, we're all going to be poets or something?
oi, slag - chops, i'm watching that!
 all right, both of you, to your rooms.
 i am not 12.
 why do you always have to do this?
you just ruin everything.
(i think the back door just opened.
if mattie's smoking again...)
you'll have a screaming row, then she'll smoke somewhere else for a bit.
fingers crossed it's only burglars.
the moon is beautiful tonight, do n't you think?
we're not taking it back.
should we be afraid of our synthetics?
hundreds of millions operational across the world and not one verified instance of a synth knowingly injuring a human.
their sole purpose is to make our lives better.
they are n't sentient, they do n't have any thought, emotion or awareness.
what if you ca n't find her?
we'll find her, maxie.
and she loves me.
but do you believe that one day we will have a truly artificially intelligent synth?
one that thinks and feels like a human?
how can we replicate something we hardly understand in ourselves?
how would we even know if we succeeded?
but you admit it's something you're working towards?
think of the problems to solve before we get there.
what is human emotion?
for example, what is love?
is it something we are born with or can it be learnt?
what about the darker feelings?
human consciousness is not complete without them.
and memory - ours are subjective, fallible...
but how do you teach a computer to forget?
it's something our minds need to do.
of course not, they're just machines.
barton: has set a new standard in the midwest.
so high that even our friends on the coasts are now paying attention.
the man that we're honoring this evening is a visionary in every sense of the word.
i have known him since he was a resident here at washington.
if there's one thing i hear during the course of my day, it's, "thanks to him, we have a family."
i am, uh... a man of science.
which is why i'll let my friend provost scully supply the words tonight.
most regrettably, i have to go.
it turns out i'm working this evening.
bill masters has yet to devise the baby guaranteed to arrive during business hours.
- but mark my words.
but i do thank you.
i thank you for honoring me here tonight.
arousal states for clients 1 and 6 were instantaneous.
4 took ten minutes, making him the slowest.
7 achieved no arousal at all.
i have 11 minutes.
well, you're the expert.
your napkin actually goes in your lap.
from a man standing in a closet watching people hump all night.
you might consider keeping a journal.
you could time a lot of this yourself, even if it's counting in your head.
what is the matter with you?
i ca n't be there every night.
we were getting so close.
client 8... uh...
i have your climax lasted approximately 9 seconds.
you did n't have an orgasm?
you're serious now?
yes, i'm serious.
almost all of them.
although i have n't checked my clipboard lately.
w - why would a woman lie about something like that?
i'm gonna be honest with you, but only 'cause i like you and you seem real dedicated about your project, in your penguin suit and all, with the charts and the timer.
have you seen her?
and they placed her in our department.
right outside the elevators, which makes it very convenient to casually run into her.
anyway, rumor is the new girl's just now getting divorced.
ex - husband's a band leader.
she was his singer, so she's probably dying for something stable.
you're not still going ahead with that, are you?
going ahead and about to enter the second phase.
support for the project grows every day.
scully is gonna present my proposal to the board.
in the meantime, i'm looking for volunteers.
i say this with the greatest respect, bill, even affection, but this study of yours is doomed.
scully will sooner approve a trip to the moon.
how will he even begin to defend this to the board?
he wo n't have to.
project's gonna be conducted in perfect secrecy.
in a teaching hospital, where no one ever gossips.
come meet the new girl with me.
do you not have patients, dr. haas?
because i will gladly reassign yours to dr. evans if you're too busy.
and your secret here is safe with me.
the interviews you've requested appear to be secretarial candidates.
now, either we're adding staff to our office, or i'm being replaced.
would you care to clarify?
the job has changed, miss horchow.
why would n't i be right for this new job?
because i have another new study pending, one that requires a secretary not at all... squeamish.
i grew up on a farm.
i've beheaded chickens.
oh, i can imagine.
but did you ever see one of those chickens fake an orgasm?
more importantly, do you know why a woman would fake an orgasm?
because that's one of the questions i hope to answer.
this new job will require taking sexual histories in intimate, explicit detail.
and to be honest, you do n't seem the kind of woman that would cotton to such a task.
i'm not sure what kind of woman would.
i'm not sure what kind of woman could hold her head up in church every sunday knowing she'd spent the entire week talking smut!
slap on whatever fancy term you like.
i'll schedule the first round of interviews as early as tomorrow.
that alone is cause for celebration.
you took your temperature?
that does n't mean you have to make a soufflé, lib.
oh, it's romantic.
quick prayer first, daddy.
dear lord... please bring us the baby we already love and adore.
sad home, where no one is waiting for me.
i have two children waiting for me.
are your kids friendly?
cause maybe they'll take pity on me and invite me in.
and i'll take that to mean you'd like me to shove off.
no, actually, i look forward to knowing you and maybe even becoming friends.
that's all my life can accommodate right now.
i must look like an idiot.
all i could think about the entire drive home was kissing you.
well, friends can kiss.
we could look in each other's eyes sometimes.
once you're pregnant.
until then... this is the most effective position.
what do you see when you look at me?
it was like something out of a movie...
that kind of movie.
first, i get the "just friends" speech.
next thing i know, she invites me in, and i get a blow job.
i know what it is.
what it is is incredible!
these are the insured patients.
dr. phillips insists that these files be kept separate from the ward patients, who are walk - ins and usually poor.
i need a directory.
i need to know all the doctors' names, their departments, their titles.
their quirks, their incomes, their marital status, their availability despite their marital status.
for example, if i wanted to know about dr. haas...
you would go to obstetrics.
he's one of the young pups.
and his boss is...?
he's the alpha dog of coochie medicine.
it was so sexy. jesus.
but what does it mean?
what does a blow job mean?
what are you... a girl?
okay, who cares what it means and why she did it?
although i do think it's the rare bird that is both elegant and smart and volunteers that kind of thing.
all i do know for sure is i am going to marry that woman.
code blue in the e.r., dr. masters.
c-section, bleeding out.
scrub up and assist, dr. haas.
i want to show you something...
your man in action.
she's lost over 4,000 cc, bill.
yes, but the hemorrhaging...
how long has she been on the table?
uh, 98 minutes.
two more. 500 cc.
- man: 70 over palp.
she's on the negro ward.
you did n't get all the placenta, for starters.
- 12 gauze packs.
i already used 12.
12 more!
i'll deliver these on my break.
let the messenger boys do that.
we have n't yet met.
are you here to interview or on some other business?
can you squeeze me in now?
i'm sure it seems unorthodox, going from nightclub singer to secretary, but i - i can assure you i am very capable, organized.
- i'm the hardest worker i know.
well, i assume that comes with the job.
i was an undergrad at drury college.
so you graduated with a b.a.?
actually, marriage interfered before i could graduate.
but i am enrolled in classes now, here at the university.
i'll have my degree by year's end.
you did n't want to get married?
are we talking about my husbands again?
so there's more than one?
i stopped at two.
so, the first marriage was for interference.
the second was for...?
i have a boy and a girl.
i believe that's average, statistically.
is it unusual that you did n't marry for love in either marriage?
you're surrounded by women.
perhaps you could best answer that question.
i'm curious as to what you have to say.
well, good housekeeping quizzes tell you that women marry for love... what they think is love.
but i think that women often confuse love with physical attraction.
but they do n't have to be.
they do n't even have to go together.
i do n't think i've ever heard a woman express such an opinion.
it's not a theory i trot out at dinner parties.
i'm guessing you're not easily flustered.
the woman in surgery today?
and would she have died had you not stepped in?
then i envy you.
they're very strict about my break.
actually, you did.
why would a woman fake an orgasm?
to get a man to climax quickly.
usually so the woman can get back to whatever it is she'd rather be doing.
i know it's late, but i need to sign up for classes now... get myself in the system, officially registered as a student.
i was thinking my emphasis of study could be nature versus nurture.
i found it very informative.
we do n't offer that as a major.
well, not as a major, necessarily.
but it must fall in the department of behavioral sciences or something.
we do n't have a department of behavioral sciences.
the article was very interesting.
it made me look at my own children in a whole new light.
go home to your children and figure out what you really want.
when i was your age,
i thought my children were important.
do you have a sociology department?
well, then i'd like you to sign me up in the sociology department as an undeclared major.
i did promise to present this to the board, but that was before i read it.
you do know what's in here?
i wrote it specifically to showcase this as a physiological study.
it's smut, bill.
as pornography or prostitution or something equally depraved.
you did n't even show it to them.
because i live in the real world.
where there are libraries on how babies are born and not a single study on how babies are made.
we are doctors, for christ's sakes, and i - i simply want to answer the question...
by using live subjects flopping around on beds.
monitored for the collection of physiological data!
oh, for goodness' sake, bill, why are you doing this?
your practice is the envy of every doctor in this hospital.
they're desperate for help.
do you know what advice i have to offer?
"get a divorce, get used to it, or cheat."
let psychiatrists help those women.
it's not medicine!
it is medicine, and i am so far out in front of it, i'm the only one who sees it.
i want to make my name in uncharted territory.
i want a nobel prize.
then this discussion is over.
this study will never be seen as serious science, and you will be labeled a pervert.
you can thank me later for saving you from yourself.
"the ed sullivan show."
imagine what my mother would say if she could see this boy.
your dinner's in the warmer.
slide it all in the sink.
i want my martini shaken by vito tonight.
scully refuses to present my study.
it's about how the human body responds to... various physical stimuli.
do n't make me explain this now.
i want a drink, then i want another drink, then...
but you said your basal temp spiked last night.
that puts you mid-cycle, not starting a new one.
but if you do n't correctly monitor...
so tired of feeling like a failure at the one thing that we want most.
two years, and nothing.
why ca n't i have a baby?
why ca n't i give my husband a child?
my wife is coming in next week.
we've decided she'll join my cervical - cap trial.
we've had great success with it, and i'd appreciate it if you help us through the admissions process.
i can imagine infertility is very stressful.
for libby, it is, yes.
but not for you?
libby has a reproductive tract incompatible with conception, which is stressful for her.
and it's certainly no secret that infertility is distracting while at the same time being endlessly tedious and annoying.
anyway, i've helped so many other couples conceive.
it seems impossible i ca n't help my own wife.
yes, it does seem unlikely.
- anyway, my shift ended an hour ago.
but do n't get too used to regular hours in this office.
i warned her you're a slave driver.
i do n't mind the long hours.
i just need some warning to make arrangements for my children.
but i've never done that before.
then you do the same thing to me.
is that what they taught you in medical school?
i'm not finding school very helpful right now.
this is even sexier.
shut up, ethan.
you are the most beautiful creature i have ever seen.
they're thinking, "why is she not in the negro ward?"
you're not in the negro ward because i moved you here.
this is where you'll get the best care.
you'll have another.
they told me i ca n't.
mrs. may, i'm your doctor now.
and when i say i will work day and night until you leave this hospital with a baby in your arms, that's what i will do.
of course, i did n't admit i have no idea what a cervical cap is.
it's a device masters invented himself.
it's basically a- a rubber cap that takes dud sperm and places it right against the cervix.
"dud" sperm?
or in masters' case, no sperm.
most of the men in the study have a low sperm count.
masters' is close to zero.
he told me himself.
his wife is the one with the problem.
do n't take it personally.
i mean, i love bill.
he's taught me so much.
championed me as a resident.
there is no way the great bill masters is going to admit he's shooting blanks.
you looked in his file.
it was right there.
i said that we'd be friends.
and i meant it.
no, it would just be...
it would be confusing for my kids and awkward for us if you stayed.
so i'm not spending the night.
you're kicking me out.
i can make you coffee for the road.
it's not like i pressure her into it.
- in fact, she pressures me.
how traumatic for you.
scar tissue on the anterior wall.
or on your honeymoon, i'm guessing.
not that i've ever been with a prostitute, but...
mrs. may needs my help.
mrs. may wants a baby and, off this, i'd put her chances at 10.
you might be able to remove the lesions surgically.
bill, i'm in love with her.
i'd be a terrible cupid.
but you see "gini" every day.
maybe you could put in a good word for me.
so we can both look like we're 12?
i am crazy about her, but she's killing me.
i mean, what is it she wants?
what does the woman you're sleeping with want?
the riddle of life itself ca n't come close to the unfathomable mystery of that question.
we start with the intake forms.
the procedure itself comes later.
being married to bill can often feel like a spectator sport.
i - i just mean you attract attention whether you want to or not.
the garden in the courtyard is nice.
we can sit there, like two girlfriends, fill out the forms.
no one will be the wiser.
there are magazines, a pillow.
you've been so kind, mrs. johnson.
i'll tell my husband you're his new secret weapon, gini.
the doc wanted me to be the last one in tonight.
i see you've started on the intake forms.
uh, only the name and address stuff.
the other questions, you can answer.
the other questions are your medical history.
how about i talk and you write?
meaning, how long have you been trying to get pregnant?
have you ever been pregnant?
do you have a history of miscarriages?
i've had three pregnancies taken care of, if you follow.
two years ago, i had my tubes tied.
please put miss dimello in room 5.
tell dr. haas to meet me in my examining room.
the cap is small, but sometimes fitting it can be uncomfortable.
a sharp pinch, apparently.
well, you'll tell me when it's over.
i wo n't be the one fitting it.
it's against hospital protocol to treat a family member.
since when do you care about protocol?
i let you follow the rules so i can break them.
careful about making me the boring one.
you're the tough one, lib.
i think we learned that long ago.
this must mean you're doing the honors, ethan.
stay for a minute, ca n't you, daddy?
i have a-a patient waiting, but i - i'll check in on you later.
no one can replace your husband.
but i have done this many times, and so far, not a single complaint.
guess i'm your first guinea pig.
my first guinea pig was year two of medical school.
but, yes, you're my first human subject on day one of my new study.
i appreciate your coming.
my mother always said i'd end up in the electric chair.
there's a reason the french call it "la petite mort."
we got everything we need?
you said nothing about a vibrator.
this is why i keep telling you why you need a female partner.
do you at least have any magazines?
with helen, in fact.
helen is my lover.
so, who's your lover?
you must love somebody.
that's an answer?
that's my personal life, which is of no interest to you or anyone else.
i'll get those magazines.
miss dimello is a patient.
i learned long ago not to judge.
but i do like your wife.
and she is down the hall enduring infertility treatments, which is why this all does seem a bit insensitive on your part, if i may be so blunt.
next time you're blunt, you might also try being right.
i hired you because i need an assistant and because i suspect you might have a gift for the work.
that said, if you're uncomfortable with what i'm doing here, speak now, and i can make other arrangements.
i'm not sure what it is you're doing.
i'm wiring miss dimello to monitor her pulse, heart rate, and brain waves to illuminate to my patients, and to the general community, what happens to the body during sexual stimulation and orgasm.
the magazines are to help with the stimulation part, because unbeknownst to me, miss dimello prefers women, which, to be frank, concerns me because it may, in fact, throw off my data.
why would it throw off your data?
that is one of the many questions i hope to answer.
but as she is my only subject, it really means i have no choice, whatever her orientation.
so are you interested in the job or not?
i'm not sure why you chose me.
even though i do n't have a college degree or know anything about biology or anatomy.
if you picked a female m.d., she'd know all of this already.
a woman doctor would never jeopardize her career on such a risky subject.
the study is not approved.
my career is in jeopardy.
i'm going ahead anyway.
how can i help?
but he must have given you the details.
well, he did.
but it's confidential.
he said i could only talk about it with women who were willing to volunteer.
volunteer for... for what?
things that we've always suspected but never had proven scientifically.
it's a whole new world that we're opening up.
very exciting, for women especially.
it will probably be the biggest change to women's lives since the right to vote.
the first two pages and the last one, okay?
our new volunteer starts tomorrow.
i just feel lucky you could fit me in at all.
gini told me there is quite a waiting list for volunteers.
as to how we'll proceed today, it's important to go over some ground rules.
gini already explained them to me.
when you look at the data, you get a very clear picture of what's happening to the subject physically.
but if you want to answer a question like,
"how does an orgasm feel for a woman?"
it's not so easy to see it in the numbers.
it's like trying to describe salt to someone who's never tasted salt.
i've tasted salt.
not the way i've tasted salt.
how does an orgasm feel for a woman?
first thing we retract is this tissue here.
this is the omentum.
once that's secured... we move to what's called the vesicouterine fold.
we know what it's called, bill.
i retract the vesicouterine fold to expose this shiny, grapefruit - sized mass here, which is the uterus.
is that the end of the lesson?
listening to our exam room.
there's some money trading hands about what's going on in there.
- i do n't know if you knew that.
i think maybe a decorator is in there now, moving furniture.
if i can make the camera small enough, it'll allow the viewer to actually witness it in real time.
but can you vary the size of the device?
because this looks big.
and some women can accommodate big much better than others, of course.
i thought we put this matter to bed.
this is work i've been doing on my own time.
an extracurricular hobby, like model building or macramé.
bill, i said no. i meant no.
what part of that do you not understand?
the part that still believes you're a scientist.
all i am asking is that you take off your management hat for five minutes.
let me show you what any real scientist would kill to see.
we call it "ulysses," after the kirk douglas movie with the giant cyclops.
it even assists with stimulation.
i do n't like where this is going.
i designed ulysses myself, using cold - light illumination and with a miniature camera lens attached inside.
who else is doing this?
who will be doing it in five years?
i do n't think this is a good idea.
it'll be just like all the other times.
except the provost of the entire university will be watching me.
he's not watching you.
he's watching science.
best seat in the house.
now, the patient controls ulysses herself.
the only thing you have to do is lean in close, like this, so you get the best possible view through the lens.
but not too close, or you'll get poked in the eye.
just think of yourself as sir edmund hillary leaving base camp.
whenever you're ready, j...
well, it's a remarkable feat.
which is why it's time to go public, barton.
time to submit this proposal to the board.
a study where a naked woman mounts a mechanical phallus!
it's not just the technology.
we've already debunked many established theories, plus charted clear - cut stages of sexual response... four in all.
we're starting to see that some women are capable of multiple orgasms.
why does your secretary keep talking to me?
i already gave you my answer.
it's not an answer i can accept.
i've made this hospital a fortune.
our patient base has tripled.
we're ranked second in the country.
our donors ca n't write checks fast enough, in large part because of me.
i got us to where we are now.
and this study, this is where we're going.
but if you wo n't support me in... in blazing that trail, then i'll find another hospital that will.
dangerous game you're playing.
oh, it's not a game.
i need an answer by the end of today.
he's not gonna call.
ethan, i'm sorry.
you're not even dressed yet.
is this about the nicu benefit?
for god's sake, ethan, go ahead.
gini can come with libby and me later.
libby's had me over twice this week.
i'm sure she'd like time alone.
and i would like a date.
so i can wait another 15 minutes.
well, we have another hour here at least.
i thought you'd broken that off.
you know, this is not research into kidney disease, which might survive some incident of inner-departmental scandal.
so even a hint of impropriety could derail all our work now, everything that's to come.
i understand you're upset about scully.
i'm not talking about scully!
now, given that every museum in the world is filled with art created from this basic impulse, the greatest literature... the most beautiful music.
i'm just so happy that you and barton made up.
it was n't exactly valentines and roses. but bill can be very persuasive, as you know.
i persuaded her to marry me.
and now i'm persuading her to find some champagne so we can celebrate.
i'll go with you, lib.
it's a good day.
i do n't have to show my hand.
i've been asking around about langham.
he's married, but he's also had affairs.
maybe i should talk to him.
langham's a doctor.
i insinuated my way in with you easily enough.
you're forgetting that i picked you for this job.
if that's what you need to tell yourself.
see if you can get him away from his wife.
i'll find you later.
and then you have to lay there, you know, with your legs up around your ears, everything completely exposed.
it hurts, like cramping, only worse.
they've taken my blood so many times, one of my veins has collapsed.
lib, all of the pain, it will all be worth it.
i think he needs it more than i do.
i mean, not the poking and prodding, of course, but the baby.
having a wife grounds him, i think.
a child could really change him.
anyway, it annoys him to no end, but i do apologize every day.
here he is, this brilliant doctor, stuck with a barren wife.
i'll be back in one moment.
you wanted to know what was going on in room 5.
that's not what this is.
the phase we're considering you for is couples.
m- my wife barely lets me see her naked.
we do n't mean you and your wife.
i'm in the process of recruiting several new female volunteers.
we preserve the anonymity of all of our volunteers.
but i already have a secretary, and i've spoken with a nurse and a hospital administrator's wife.
only hookers and insane co-eds would agree to this.
have you signed on?
i am dr. masters' associate.
otherwise, i would have no reservations about volunteering.
all of our subjects know they're advancing the cause of science.
these are young, good - looking women.
austin, trust me on this.
this whole thing feels like...
yes, your wife told me.
your wife, who's been standing by herself at the bar the last 20 minutes.
i'll be back in a moment, gentlemen.
merry christmas to us all.
ethan, let go of me!
you're hurting me!
you ca n't answer, can you?
how many times have we slept together?
just come back inside with me.
it's not that tough a question.
we are not going to have this conversation now.
when is a good time, virginia?
because i have n't seen you in weeks.
you see me every day.
i have n't seen you alone!
you work late every night!
you ride home now with that bow - tied asshole!
it's not an excuse.
please. do n't do this.
do n't not talk to me.
that i do n't like being dragged out here in the cold when you're drunk and insulting?
why would i insult you when you're all i think about?!
i have been in your bed.
i have been inside you.
what am i not doing?
or doing too much of?
you know, what can i do better?
do not say "friend."
people in love with each other, they do.
i care about you, ethan.
you'll make love to me.
you'll let me do anything, everything to you.
it's because i like it, because you like it.
i do it because i love you.
i'm sorry that i hurt you.
that was never my intention.
wear the lab coat, virginia.
play doctor all you want.
i'm going to have a baby.
that is such happy news.
so, so happy.
once you two get settled, i will attach the leads.
while we just lay there naked?
there's a sheet, if you're feeling shy.
we'll see how it goes.
that's the fun of being first.
i'm anonymous, too.
i'll take your gowns.
make yourselves comfortable on the bed.
now, there really are no rules in terms of what you can and ca n't do.
you simply need to move through all four stages so we can monitor the response.
we start with excitement.
to plateau, which is usually intercourse, but can also be more foreplay.
then orgasmic... that's self - explanatory, i think.
ending with refractory, the body's physiological reflexes returning back to normal.
all of this comes very naturally, so i would n't get too in your head about it.
and, uh, all the wires?
i would advise going slowly.
more fun that way.
now, whenever you two are ready.
your cheekbone is bruised.
watch out for open medicine cabinets.
can i kiss you?
you know, i think we did meet once...
dr. shaw's birthday party.
you were the one with clothes on.
i do have one concern... about the possibility of sexual transference between us and our patients.
but the likelihood of us transferring all this libidinous energy onto our patients is high.
is this something you're struggling with?
no, but i could see the beginnings of it already between you and langham.
he was flirting with you...
i was trying to make him feel comfortable.
he was sitting there with an erection.
which is why we need to implement a system, uh, that ensures this kind of transference does n't occur.
it did n't occur.
so you wo n't object to devising a- a system that avoids any doctor  patient conflict.
i wo n't object, but why do n't you just come out and say whatever it is you're trying to say?
the two of us should undertake the research ourselves.
bill, that would be transference.
we should undertake the research with each other.
i've considered this carefully, and i - i realized it's the best way to ensure the longevity of the project.
we get the benefit of interpreting the data firsthand, plus, it deflects any inappropriate projection away from our patients.
keeps it just between us.
can i take the weekend to think about this?
good night, then.
i walk and watch and listen a witness to all the beauty and ugliness that is disappearing from our beloved city.
last week took me to the gray depths of the east river where dimitri panchenko swims his morning laps like he has every morning since the 1960s.
today i walked by the acres of scaffolding outside what used to be the plaza hotel and i thought about eloise.
remember kay thompson's eloise?
eloise who lived in the plaza hotel with her dog weenie and her parents, who were always away and her english nanny who had eight hairpins made out of bones.
stories of a city that is disappearing before our eyes.
so, what will be left of those stories?
are we going to have to construct an imaginary city to house our memories?
because when you love something, every time a bit of it goes you lose a piece of yourself.
so where's eloise going to sleep tonight?
"has anyone seen my turtle, skipperdee?"
did eloise really mean that much to you?
were n't you ever a little girl?
not the kind of little girl that remembers the name of her turtle.
i'm just a voice.
the shows are on the website.
people can download them for free.
- what are you wearing?
green scrubs, tied at the waist, very sexy v- neck.
- how about the sexy green hat?
you like it more than the others, less than the others or the same?
i'm at the place and i wanna make sure you're still okay with the cream and the orange.
actually, it's not cream.
for tonight, if you meet me at nicole's art thing you do n't have to talk to anyone but me.
- you're not coming?
i love you too.
the laundromat is in a town in jersey where diane arbus used to do her laundry.
- oh, that gun store is down in chinatown.
berenice abbott shot it in the '30s.
it's really evocative, you know?
you have to convince him to come to one of these things.
he ca n't avoid us forever.
do n't you love this woman?
you guys this, when it starts, it's disgusting.
- we have to go.
i hate you so much.
are you gonna be that crabby when you get older?
look, she gave me an apple.
so she is human.
- that was too big a bite.
do n't give it to him.
why ca n't we go down to city hall tonight?
she wants the invitations and the band playing and the minister.
that's the nicest thing you ever said to me.
did he go up there?
thanks for finding him.
but i get a reward or something?
- you're hurting him!
- give me the dog.
you just made my day!
- did you get any sleep?
she was dead on arrival and her fingerprints are all over the gun.
- so he's laughing again.
i'll meet you over there.
- can i talk to her?
can i have a word with you?
we're just gonna be right here.
you know, sweetie something you should know.
and if she could, she would tell you that you can trust me.
did your stepfather hurt your mommy?
you do n't have the right.
and you know how this whole thing works.
you done been through this a thousand times.
you hire your lawyers and you do your thing.
- i heard her show once.
you had the service?
they did n't know when you were going to wake up if you were going to wake up.
you were gone for three weeks.
i wanna see him again.
you gotta help us here.
let's start over again.
he hit your boyfriend with the pipe.
once, twice, three times?
you're the good guys.
please leave a message for david and erica after the beep.
what kind of case did you have?
my boyfriend was beaten to death.
do you have a complaint report number?
- and what was his name?
it might be under erica bain.
i realize how difficult this can be but if you'd please be patient and have a seat over there an officer will be down shortly to help you.
i realize how difficult it can be but if you'd please be patient and have a seat over there an officer will be down shortly to help you.
oh, yeah, of course.
i need a license, yeah.
i need to get something now.
i wo n't survive 30 days.
loads from the handle.
i'll throw in the bullets.
you should n't smoke.
- you should n't be working this late.
you said this was business, sean.
- you heard about that murrow thing, right?
women do n't shoot themselves in the face.
at least in my experience.
where do they shoot themselves, in your experience?
jackie, i been chasing after this asshole for three straight years.
and right when his wife was ready to turn state's evidence on him instead of blowing the lid off of him, she blows off her own head.
so what can i do?
well, she has a daughter.
and her daughter knows something.
but now he's asked for custody of her and then he's gonna get it.
- and you want her made a ward of court.
sean, i'm your ex-wife.
try seeing them now.
i can hear you breathing.
looks like he was a roadie for aerosmith.
what does that tell us?
well, she took three in the torso with a .38.
then somebody smoked him with a 9 mm automatic.
do n't ask me who, though.
and we found these casings.
- but where's the tape?
and why did n't he take the money?
they chickened out, got scared?
we got three casings, only one hit.
one that has your arms your legs your eyes.
building sprout - like chromosomes on the dna of its streets.
i've got two shows that are almost finished.
they're already mixed.
all they need is an intro and an outro, which i could do live.
i've got six shows in various stages.
i've got all these stories in my files.
and i know what i'm doing, and you know that i know what i'm doing.
you've been through so much.
you need more time before you put yourself out there.
- do n't make me beg.
but we have a public and i'm not sure you're ready for it yet.
you telling me i ca n't work because of what happened?
look i just need to keep living.
i do n't wanna disappear.
is there anything we can cut to?
new york like any metropolis is...
women afraid to walk home alone people afraid of white powder in their mailbox darkness and night.
i always believed that fear belonged to other people.
it never touched me.
and your skin crawls and your heart sickens and you look at the person you once were walking down that street and you wonder, will you?
hey, what sounds you got up in there, dog?
do n't nobody talk in new york no more?
now, you wanna grow up to be like that punk ass?
- i'm keeping this joint.
- you kidding me, right?
so you gonna give me some radiohead too?
i should have walked out of that train.
i could've just shown them the gun, and they would n't have hurt me.
why do n't my hands shake?
why does n't somebody stop me?
we've got two confirmed shot on a subway from brooklyn. church street, lower manhattan.
everyone's arguing whose jurisdiction.
did you check with bci?
yeah, i got this printout.
- they here yet?
- and i'll get them to you.
well, i hope this is their stop.
- i do n't think this is his.
money in his pocket.
looks like a 9 mm automatic.
- like from the other night?
check it against brass catchers, see if it matches.
the kind of guy you would n't even notice.
it's a new investigation.
i'm sorry, but we're not...
excuse me, do n't i know you?
- what's your name?
it would be about you.
my life's not that interesting.
so you gonna give me some radiohead too?
how the hell did this get out so quick?
you ever listen to nkw?
- she shows up at the subway last night and guess who she wants to interview?
you should totally do it.
remember that bernie goetz thing?
hey, is carter in?
reporters calling in the night.
have him call me at my desk.
what's she want with you?
give her my number.
you know what i want?
i want everyone in the market that night everyone on the subway, outside.
somebody has to have seen this guy.
- see who it belongs to.
you've been avoiding the full glare of my disapproval.
the show sucked and everybody hated it.
well, we do n't normally do silence on wnkw.
you almost managed a full minute.
you got 11 more steps, do you?
i thought we were better than some am confessional but people are responding.
i'm detective mercer.
you remember me from last night?
- yeah, well i saw you in the hospital after...
after what had happened to you and to your friend.
my wife, she used to listen to your show all the time and that was why i stopped you in the subway.
i just wanted you to know that.
you know, it was disturbing.
i mean, you were gone.
and to see somebody that ca n't see you, it...
i know you do.
you see i checked into your case.
- you checked into my case?
we got two of the best detectives in this city that's working on this and we will find them.
are policemen always so confident?
are you interviewing me now?
five minutes, tops.
we can do it over here.
it's amazing what a dead body can tell you.
so the dead do talk?
and those bodies at the subway, what are they telling you?
why do i know him?
that's mr. murrow.
he owns the parking out on roosevelt island.
what else does he do?
- you really wanna know?
whatever's in demand.
found three guys that had crossed him with their hands superglued to a table and expanding cement in their throats.
now he's got custody of his stepdaughter and not for sentimental reasons. but he knows she knows something and i hate to think what's gonna happen to her.
but maybe you know a nicer side.
and why ca n't you nail him?
because i follow the law.
well, there's nothing you can do?
so there's nothing you can do?
no matter how bad i feel about it.
i petitioned that she be made a ward of the court but his lawyers killed that one stone dead, so...
did your hands shake?
a benefit that that asshole and the subway shooter do n't have.
and you think they're the same?
let me ask you a question.
how did you pull it back together after what happened to you?
you become someone else.
you must have loved him very much.
sometimes that just makes it harder, you know.
you just wish you did n't.
that's my card.
but am i finding them or are they finding me?
so, what would 50 dollars do for you?
- should n't she be at home?
- she got no home.
- you're looking for a show in the back seat?
what's your name, honey?
are you a mommy?
you know them suicide bombers over in iraq?
when they die they want 72 virgins.
i want them while i'm alive.
- you ai n't going nowhere.
how long have you been in it?
but you wanna go now, do n't you?
then i'll be the last supercunt you'll ever see.
go on. not until he pays me.
i went there from albuquerque.
well, you got enough money to get you home now.
you're okay, come on.
let me turn you over.
who the hell are you?
there is no going back to that other.
you walking out the heat?
your hands are cold as ice.
you never said my name before.
i heard your show.
ballistic tests have linked last night's shooting with the shooting from the market and the shooting from the subway, so...
are you saying the same gun was used in all three shootings?
sources are saying the witness can provide a description but has refused to talk.
now, thank you, that's everything.
so, what, is this guy becoming an obsession with you?
yeah, well, ai n't nobody doing my job for me.
you heard my show.
you gotta think every one of those reporters in that room is gonna sensationalize this.
how can you tell?
well, you do n't fit our audience profile.
how's the girl doing?
- no, that's incitement.
- wish he'd take care of my ex.
- you think that's funny?
i suppose you think lethal injection's funny too.
i'm thinking about opening up your show.
you mean the shootings?
- you really think that that's appropriate?
but you're good at it.
- i'm not asking you to personalize it.
no more than you already have.
the essential american soul is hard isolate, stoic, and a killer.
it has never yet melted. "
i quote that from d.h. lawrence because someone is playing god out there killing in the name of justice, in this the safest big city in the world.
this is a new departure for us but we wanna hear from you so call 212-165-9990.
because no matter what the media tells us crimes are being committed, and he's cleaning it up.
and you think he has the right to do that.
you're talking about murder.
the vigilante is just like the people he's killing.
he should be in jail.
that's why we have war, why we got the death...
- i think it's good for new york.
i mean, this city was turning into disneyland.
- we're getting our street cred back.
you're on the air.
i wonder if the vigilante has a girlfriend because there's something sexy about...
and if he's listening, my number is 2...
- this is the vigilante calling.
i'm the man that takes care of business.
- i need to talk to someone.
- ma'am, can i help you?
- no "erica bain" under homicide.
you gonna give me some radiohead too?
- because i could not stop for death...
... he kindly stopped for me.
the carriage held but just ourselves.
- is everything okay?
what do you do when you ca n't sleep?
- is n't that hard?
well, come on, what's happening?
did you sleep better when your wife was beside you?
so i called her a mackerel.
i guess that's not the worst thing in the world to wake up to.
you've been good to me.
you told me it'd be there and it better be.
why do you think you can hurt people?
- just do damage and walk away.
do n't you know what you leave behind?
- do i know you?
- do you think about it?
does it keep you up at night?
are you one of them press paparazzo freaks?
well, it looks like he fell from up there.
cause of death could be the fall. it could be the crowbar stuck in his skull.
i'd say 50 - 50 either way.
maybe 70 - 30.
how many people wanted this prick dead?
the problem is he knew all of them.
he would n't let anybody get this close to him.
you think someone did us a favor?
maybe we should put him on the payroll.
what, like someone think they're doing our job for us?
- i ca n't because...
what kind of trouble are you in?
you do n't wanna know.
were you a nurse?
when i had to be.
i killed a man tonight.
because he did this to you?
i would've killed him anyway.
back home they gave young boys guns.
made them kill their parents.
anyone can be a killer.
each death leaves a hole waiting to be filled.
did the me come back with his liver temperature yet?
dead about two hours from when we got there.
- about 1:00, give or take.
okay, i want everyone from the subway and from that market killing i want them all brought in again.
- we've done all of that.
we need to do it again.
what about the ipod?
you said it traced back to a kid.
i thought i told you.
no, i just wanna know how you slept. hey, you wanna see what i do?
now sit your hippie ass down.
- i need to talk to you.
does your dad know you smoke grass, huh?
that's a lot more than a misdemeanor these days.
so, what time you got to sleep last night?
yeah. i ended up working all night.
you know you're not gonna be able to reference this on your show?
we're gonna interview a witness to a shooting.
- is n't that against procedure?
but i've tried to talk to her twice and she seemed real nervous to talk to me.
i figure maybe if you were there, she'll talk.
because you got me to talk.
how are we feeling today?
so you feel like telling me what happened to you that night now?
you should tell them what you saw.
whatever it was, tell them the truth.
and nobody saw me.
sorry if that upset you.
well, i'm sorry that i could n't be more help back there.
she sure liked your necklace.
it meant a lot to me.
- why'd you call me last night?
i told you, i could n't sleep.
and you were in bed?
you wanna tell us again why you did n't wanna come in?
to get back my i pod?
- you were glad?
i know i should n't be, but i was.
those guys smacked me around and took my ipod.
yeah, just a woman.
can you describe this woman well enough for an artist to make a sketch?
where are you going with this woman thing?
just think about the first moment that you met her.
where you were, where she was.
tell me anything that comes to mind.
but she had some ass.
you know, you could tell because...
like, they were little, like kate moss titties.
- but they looked good with...
- hey, you know what i do remember?
you left a hole in me.
but i'm done now.
i knew he was bullshitting us.
the mind gets so saturated with popular images it's often difficult, especially for people under 20, to recall something unique.
he owns the parking out on roosevelt island.
that's not all he does.
- you really wanna know?
- where'd you find it?
a uniform pinched the suspect's girlfriend trying to pawn it.
he fit the description that you gave.
i need a favor from you.
i'll get my stuff.
do you recognize anyone?
where do you know them from?
and what did they do?
number one, approach the mirror.
damn, i thought we had him.
you think she just froze up?
i was kind of hoping i was finally done.
i can barely remember his hands.
perhaps you need to forget.
i miss who i was with him.
you know that feeling?
you know this is mughal.
it was a gift from david's grandmother.
you know, someone gave me a gift the other night.
you recall that guy we saw on tv at the coffee shop?
the one i've been trying to put away for three years.
apparently somebody else must've had something against him because we're not talking about a 9 mm here.
i would ask myself, if there was someone that i knew that had committed a crime would i have the fortitude to put them away?
i always hoped that i would have the courage and the dedication to say yes.
it's what i admire about you.
and i'm sure you'll find it.
you're a good detective.
hey. - i wonder what david would think of...
hey, can i get joey mortell?
i got you stuck in traffic, 88th and 3rd avenue.
get yourself a slice.
- you are gonna be there that long because i got traffic backed up on 3rd all the way to 96th street.
- make yourself comfortable.
can you run a trace on a call?
and i do n't have a subpoena.
but you'll get one, right?
two days ago, july 20th between 12 and 1:30 a.m.
-... 157 - 1431.
you seen this ring before?
what'd she look like?
- do you know this number?
hey, you guys, are 917...
- are you shauna?
- did you just call me?
- tell me where he is!
i saw what they did to you.
did she tell you she was someplace else?
keep this to yourself until i can get that subpoena.
- 90 clayton avenue.
- do n't you know there's a leash law?
i made your boyfriend smile.
- you think you can come after me, huh?
- stay out of this!
- this is between him and me!
now give me the gun.
- you gonna arrest him?
- give me the gun.
- give me the gun, i said.
- ai n't nobody talking to you.
you can take me now.
you see, there was never any vigilante.
it was just three punks out on a killing spree.
they got a taste for it up in central park.
and they bought themselves a gun.
and somehow i got winged and i did what i had to do.
- you only shoot bad guys?
i've joined that club.
now you get out of here before i lose my temper.
well, francis and i are only halfway there, but i bet you know your husband as well as you know yourself.
i know what keeps him up at night.
how can i ensure a better future for my family?
you know what he said to me last night?
i want to be able to look every single american in the eye, and know that i have made their lives better. "
i have to say, mrs. underwood, i find you very charming. and you seem quite honest.
but i have trouble believing that your husband truly cares about people.
he's dedicated and generous.
and i have 28 years of proof.
and i can honestly say, even if i was n't married to him, he would definitely have my vote.
what do these five fingers have in common?
mr. king, i would like to respond to that.
this is a man who believes in the rule of law - ish.
is this the man who should be president?
ms. dunbar, like any good lawyer, you have a knack for rhetoric- ish.
but the american people are tired of words.
what they crave is action.
my concern about focusing on the word, "action," is that she'll just come back with failed actions.
america works, the un mission.
"action" performed well with key demos in our last poll.
we have been saying, "a vote for frank underwood is a vote for america works."
you need a word that goes beyond america works. - something that can be used for anything.
- remy, what do you think?
- we're talking about the word, "action."
my mind was on the foreign policy argument.
- what about "vision"?
is n't that too generic?
that's what we want.
people can project anything they want on "vision."
i'll get it polled before tomorrow.
we should work on sharp next.
thank you for taking your role so seriously, donald.
you should consider a career on the stage.
because he sure as hell is n't gonna be on my ticket.
you're good at this.
three decades of campaigns, you learn how to read an audience.
self - promotion gives me hives.
honestly, i do n't know how you do it.
i'm promoting my husband, not myself.
that's a convenient way to spin it, do n't you think?
are you always this blunt?
i only have two days to tag along.
mind if i ride with you, since we have so little time?
i need to make some calls.
maybe we'll find some time later.
remy, you were distracted earlier.
i need you on your a - game, remy.
this debate could make us the front - runner.
it's just between the campaign and managing the white house, - i'm a little burnt out.
- we still have months to go. - a year before the general.
if you can do it, i can.
you still ca n't believe she's dead, can you?
cause she's not.
she's alive, and i know exactly where she is.
i've known for a while.
- look on your laptop.
you showed me the picture. - of her body.
- that was n't her.
i forged it all so you'd lift my passport lock.
but my friend is n't.
get him the same deal you got me, all charges dropped.
you do that, and i'll tell you where she is.
- hey, meechum.
thank you for coming all the way to andrews.
did remy walk you through the broad strokes?
no matter the policy question, foreign or domestic, we hammer dunbar's lack of experience.
we can not say "lack of experience" enough.
and no doubt, she'll bring up claire's recess appointment, where i ca n't take the bait, so i leave that entirely to you.
this was one of the things that i was hoping to discuss.
oh, you do n't want to call her "sexist"?
- the argument does n't hold.
she says that claire was unqualified.
you say she would n't say that about a man with the same cv.
and calling another woman sexist when there's a man on the stage --
and who else is better but you to call her out on what she's done for women, which is absolutely nothing?
whereas gender - equality legislation is one of your hallmarks.
but it could hurt me more than it hurts her.
you were gonna play pit bull while i play presidential.
will you get a little bloody?
but that's what people want in their debates.
and then you and i together, we bury her.
you drop out next week, endorse me and the race is over.
i have no problem being forceful.
- i really do n't want to involve them.
but there has to be another way.
she wants to trumpet an equal playing field?
then why does she send her own kids to private school?
that is a clear and simple argument that everyone can get their heads around.
and it does n't hurt that iowa's biggest employer is the public school system.
alan sends his kids to private school.
yeah, but they're not your kids.
they're my step - kids. and that makes me a hypocrite.
is that really what you're concerned about?
it's my family.
oh, trust me, they'll understand the moment they step into the white house.
jackie, i really should n't have to convince you to do what it takes to get a set of keys.
i'll be the pit bull, mr. president.
- the press has boarded, sir.
- all right, make sure no one sees her.
such a pity how much ruthless pragmatism gets weighed down by family values.
without her doctor and his pimply - faced brood, she could soar as high as this plane.
oh, i know, the marriage was my idea.
what, did you get locked out or something?
i felt the need to drink.
i got this far and i stopped myself.
i wanted you to see it.
that i could control it.
you wanna go back up?
there was this girl...
so i started drinking.
i tried to shut her out, but i just kept checking my e-mails, my text messages.
it needed to stop.
what matters is that you got pushed to the edge today and you did n't fall off.
you did what you had to do.
and i do n't think it's crazy.
we could've met somewhere a little warmer.
walmart wanted to knock this down, build a store here.
because they would n't give a tax credit unless entry - level wages were higher.
- well, i think i know your answer.
jackie, you have repeatedly opposed the minimum - wage and ceo salary bill - i asked the leadership to introduce.
- i've put a lot of thought into it.
this community took a stand.
if enough of them do, congress wo n't have a choice but to act.
are we here to talk about legislation?
because we both have a debate in six hours.
i want to endorse you.
i'll lay off you tonight.
you and i attack underwood.
in three days, i'll drop out and endorse.
- we have n't even had the first caucus.
i have 14 points in iowa, twelve in new hampshire.
you get my people, you have a clear win in both states.
how much does underwood value it?
- what did he offer you?
i'm more interested in what you have to offer.
did he promise a cabinet position?
he offered to put you on the ticket, did n't he?
i would n't expect to be on your ticket, heather.
i was thinking secretary of defense, given my war record.
but i'd be open to other ideas.
i would love your support, jackie, but i offer you nothing.
i'm not gonna start selling off cabinet positions before i've won the white house.
those decisions will be based purely on merit.
if i'm gonna lock up this nomination for you, i deserve to be compensated.
i plan on winning, jackie.
then i'm sticking with underwood.
is jackie in here?
the patient almost did n't make it.
- but he's alive?
- do you like?
- what'd she offer?
she could lock this up.
i have to say, i almost... respect it.
anyway, you were right.
stick with the devil you know.
are the kids watching tonight?
they've got all their friends over at the house.
you can mess up my hair all you want after the debate.
thank all of you so very much for working so hard to make sure we take new hampshire.
it is field offices like this that win primaries, and the president wants you to know how much your dedication means to us.
- now, who's ready to watch a debate?
there is a large crowd here in sioux city tonight.
i would say potential voters, but of course, here in iowa, citizens caucus instead of vote, and many of the people here in this room will be doing just that on january 15th.
a cnn orc poll has it as a tight race between the two front - runners.
heather dunbar at 32 percent.
president frank underwood at 30 percent.
congresswoman jackie sharp trails in third at 14 percent. twenty - two percent remain undecided.
you can switch it.
- unless you want to watch.
- no, i thought you would.
it's your last night here.
i want to spend it with my brother, not frank underwood.
what do you want to watch instead?
if you're a clean freak, this'll definitely make you a germ freak.
- i love this movie.
i'm john king and i'll be your moderator tonight.
our debate will be divided in two parts, the first part focusing on foreign policy, part two focusing on the domestic agenda.
i will ask one candidate a question. that candidate will have one minute to answer.
after that, all of our candidates can engage in an open conversation lasting for five minutes.
we begin, though, with opening statements.
and by lottery, it was decided that president underwood goes first.
i believe that i have shown a clear vision to this country with america works, the most comprehensive jobs program in nearly a century.
we showed it could work in washington dc.
we need now to take what we did there and spread it nationwide, so that the american dream can become the american reality.
but that vision is n't enough on its own.
you need someone with experience to make it happen.
and between my time in congress and now at the white house, i have more experience than both of my opponents combined.
and, uh, when you hire someone for a job, are you gonna hire someone with 30 years' experience, or someone with less than ten or someone with no experience at all?
where i come from down south, we call that as clear as a glass of moonshine.
well, i agree with the president.
vision and experience are exactly what america needs.
you can call america works visionary, but in truth, it is just an ultra-conservative agenda that's been around for decades.
dismantle the safety net and hang people out to dry.
as for the president's experience, he was in the leadership during one of the most ineffective decades in congressional history.
as president, he has failed at everything he's done.
america works was illegal in the minds of many legal experts, myself included.
his jordan valley plan was a disaster.
if that's what you call experience, you're not just padding the résumé, you are fabricating it.
president underwood is n't presenting us with a vision, he is convincing himself of his own delusion.
now, my vision is to tackle corporate greed, raise pay for those who need it most, and create jobs by growing the economy, not robbing people of their retirement and health care.
my experience is 20 years defending the constitution.
you know when i take my presidential oath, i will mean every word of it.
ms. dunbar, thank you.
as many of you know, i am a us army veteran.
now, i've seen firsthand the great sacrifices my fellow servicemen and women have made defending this country.
but how can we ask them to protect a system that is n't protecting us?
take women, for example.
there are two women at this debate running for president.
but out in the general workforce?
even worse is minority women earning 67 cents on the dollar.
now, ms. dunbar can talk about balancing the scales, but she inherited a multi-billion - dollar fortune and never had to earn any cents on the dollar.
now, i do n't agree with everything that president underwood has done or proposes, but at least he knows what it means to work for a living.
i can give you even better than that.
i know what it means to fight for a living.
and i will fight for fairness here at home just as fiercely as i fought our enemies overseas.
let's move to part one: foreign policy.
and the first question is for you, mr. president.
given the recent volatile events in the jordan valley, do you still believe it was correct to assemble the united nations coalition and to intervene, or is it time now to call that intervention a mistake?
well, i will answer that question, john, but i'd like to address first something ms. dunbar said a few moments ago.
america works is not some stale, old, conservative agenda.
you name me one republican who has suggested using federal funds to guarantee jobs for every american who wants one and i will eat my hat.
this is n't about dismantling government. it is about --
are n't we supposed to be talking about foreign policy?
because it's easier to talk about america works than to defend your indefensible un mission.
at least i have a record to defend, ms. dunbar.
speaking of your record, mr. president, you went on record saying you would n't run for president. - and yet here you are.
- john, it seems that your very thoughtful rules have gone out the window.
you have no respect for rules, mr. president.
take fema, for example.
oh, you want to talk about fema now instead of foreign policy.
i am just following your lead, sir.
see what a mess we get into when we follow your brand of leadership?
well, i must admit that ms. dunbar does have many years of experience making rhetorical arguments in court.
you've just seen proof of that today.
but serving the american people is not about what you say, it's about what you do.
i have to agree that ms. dunbar's lack of experience is a concern.
i find it ironic that the president talks about the importance of experience, given the fact that he appointed his wife un ambassador - despite her utter lack of credentials.
- that's a sexist comment.
you would n't be making that argument if a female president had appointed her husband.
a husband with the same lack of international affairs experience as claire underwood?
in fact, it makes me question your advocacy for women in general.
well, that's ridiculous.
what have you done to further gender equality?
what have you done to balance the scales?
but that is simply not true.
can, can you name one specific thing?
being a woman, who has served as solicitor general, one of the few in the history of the court.
well, that advanced your interests, but what did that do for 150 million women out there?
the very fact that a woman can hold that position --
- so you are a symbol.
me and many other women, including yourself --
okay, but how does that get us from 77 cents on the dollar to 100?
well, now you're just aping the president's rhetoric.
how could you possibly misconstrue my words?
i speak for myself.
i am not aping the president or any other man.
i'm sorry, i wo n't engage with this --
and you need to confront the fact that you do not have women's best interests at heart.
john, this is getting out of hand.
we are in the foreign policy portion of this debate. ms. dunbar, let me bring this question to you.
you're critical of the president. you say it's indefensible, what he has done in the jordan valley.
but specifically, what would you do differently?
well, john, i'm glad you asked that.
- i need to go back to the hotel.
i really wish i could stay, but i have a very full day tomorrow. i should rest up.
but again, i want to thank you all for your hospitality and all of your hard work.
good night, everyone.
oh, you should go back inside with the volunteers and have the full campaign experience.
i did n't come to new hampshire for that.
i came to speak with you.
my brain is a bit fried.
is it what sharp said? why you do n't want to watch anymore?
- the sexist comment?
- oh, i honestly do n't care.
who can get the most points, right?
and the first question goes to you, congresswoman.
the president speaks of america works.
ms. dunbar wants to raise minimum wage. talks about regulating executive pay.
but a lot of people are n't quite clear about your economic policy.
what specifically, i underscore "specifically," would you do if elected president?
first and foremost, i want to press for gender equality and close the salary gap.
if half of the working population has more money in their pockets, that will catalyze spending, which will grow the economy, which will, in turn, create more jobs.
i think that gender equality is very important.
and under my amworks program, there will be a provision that all a mworks jobs, there can be no discrepancy in pay between men and women.
amworks jobs, that's the government.
what about the rest of the private sector?
we have to start by leading by example, then we introduce --
if america works is how you lead by example...
if that is how you lead by example, then are we to assume that everyone should illegally raid funds that they have no right to use?
everyone should start robbing banks?
holding up liquor stores?
now, ms. dunbar, with all due respect, you can criticize my programs as much as you want, but to accuse me of illegal activity --
one thing you ca n't deny is that i am much more of an authority on the constitution than you are, mr. president.
ms. dunbar, all three of us on this stage have taken oaths of office.
i would have to say that we have all defended the constitution.
you do n't have some special claim on the constitution.
the constitution belongs to everyone in this room and every citizen in the united states.
but i would ask ms. sharp, you voted in favor of dismantling america works.
was that because you thought it was in fact, as ms. dunbar says, illegal?
i voted for dismantlement because i wanted to make sure we were prepared for the hurricane, not because i thought your reading of the stafford act was illegal per se.
honestly, you think the president had a right to do what he did?
it's an appropriations issue, not a legal one.
he basically walked into fema and said,
"stick'em up and show me where the vault is."
so now i'm a bank robber.
six gun underwood, what they call me in south carolina.
i'm sorry, but i do not find this funny.
we put 50,000 people to work in washington dc.
with money she never earned, but which she inherited.
now, it is easy to talk about the problems of the poor with a silver spoon in your mouth.
am i well - off?
so was fdr when he developed the new deal.
since when does one's income determine one's amount of empathy?
would you send your kids to public school?
let's keep our children out of this.
you want your kids to have a head start, to have an advantage over the kids in public schools.
lots of americans, of all ranges of income, choose to send their children to private or parochial schools.
but is n't it true that you want your children to have a leg up on everyone else?
is that balancing the scales? or is that hypocrisy?
or maybe it's that you did n't want to raise them yourself so you sent them to boarding school.
you must really want to be president.
i would never in a million years bring up your children in a debate.
the way you choose to raise them is your business.
do i want the best for my kids?
i imagine you're the same way.
well, i'm sure you're both excellent mothers. but perhaps we should get back to some --
congresswoman sharp raised the issue of sexism earlier.
now, it is an important point, and we need to address it.
the congresswoman is correct in saying that all aspects of it should be illegal.
and then, she accused me of being sexist for criticizing claire underwood.
but would n't that same logic hold true for you, ms. sharp?
would you have come after my kids if i were a man?
are n't you trying to paint the picture that i'm a bad mother, shipping my kids off to some far - flung place?
because you know if you can make me seem like a bad mother, then how could anyone possibly support me?
that's not hardball, that is just disgusting.
well, i have to say i do think ms. dunbar has a point.
i mean, speaking of hypocrisy, do n't you send your own kids to private school, congresswoman?
- what was your point?
john, i think i've said all i need to say on this subject.
next question goes to you, ms. dunbar.
most of them give frank underwood the win. not by a lot.
but did he do enough to overtake dunbar, become the front - runner?
george, i do n't think it's so much what underwood did, but what he did n't do.
and when the attacks came his way, he held the high ground.
now, dunbar and sharp, they came out swinging, and i think it hurt them both.
yeah, but sharp had to do something.
she's 20 points behind the other two.
but the sexism thing? and going after dunbar's kids?
- it seemed quite desperate.
i do n't know about that. dunbar could've fared far worse.
she took it on the chin, held her own, and in my opinion, it was a tie.
but bottom line, does this debate change anything?
does it affect the caucus, does it affect the primary in new hampshire?
let's not forget that it's remarkable that a sitting president is n't considered the front - runner to begin with.
- he said she's not picking up, sir.
would you like me to have him knock on her door?
no, that's all right.
you have n't said a word.
well, you've been prepping for days.
i thought you might want a break from talking.
you're disappointed in me.
that the kids got mentioned.
probably thrilled... that they got mentioned at all.
if i'm disappointed in anyone, it's him, for throwing you under the bus.
i gotta fly back with you tonight.
do n't you have events tomorrow?
thank you all for coming in.
all right, i'll give you some privacy.
this should only take 15 minutes. - so just holler out if you need anything.
pull up a chair.
we can talk while this finishes up.
i should be doing this, too.
i'm sure we could get another lawn chair in here.
i was a junkie once upon a time.
what would you call this color?
scarlet is n't right.
it's not crimson or maroon.
no, i know that.
but you know she always tells everyone she bakes them herself and i know she does n't.
thank you for your support.
is there some reason we could n't do this by phone?
this needed to be in person.
yes, but you canceled all your events.
i want to talk about the debate.
she spent half the debate on the defensive.
- i humiliated myself.
- you got a little beat up, that's all.
- and you threw the biggest punch.
- oh, you mean the thing about your kids?
that was n't what we discussed.
i had to hit you hard so she would n't.
i'm not comfortable with the dynamic we've established.
what dynamic is that?
the leash you have me on.
how i'm supposed to roll over and do any trick you want.
you're taking me for granted.
how fortunate i am to have you "sort of" on my team?
you're not "happy" with our dynamic?
well, i'm not happy with your attitude.
if anything, you're taking me for granted.
- we had a deal, jackie.
but do not be under any illusions.
this is not a partnership of equals.
if you are to be my vice president, you will do what i ask.
and we will not have this conversation every time you feel uncomfortable with what i ask you to do, or how i choose to conduct myself.
- are we still sticking to the timeline?
are we still sticking to the timeline? i drop out next week?
i see no reason why you should n't.
- thank you, mr. president.
- see you in iowa.
why did you change your hair back to blonde?
that's your burning question?
how does that help the book?
but right now, i got nothing.
we changed it because blonde polls better with the voters.
you hate it, do n't you?
they feed off the energy.
you are literally giving your blood.
plenty of people give blood who are n't married to politicians.
very few people campaign for someone who just fired them.
he tell you that?
he said he betrayed you.
three days later, you change your hair back to blonde and resign so you can, quote, "devote yourself to the campaign."
i did the math.
does that bother you?
just a little light - headed.
you ever have that feeling?
do you need me to get someone?
he proposed and i said...
i said seven years.
if it's still good, another seven.
i do n't hate campaigning.
how much you need each other?
i did n't jump.
i did n't step back.
- she passed out.
mrs. underwood? can you hear me?
so all these three girls, they got a different papi or what?
they got the blonde, they got the redhead, they got the brunette.
and that's petticoat junction, right?
- may we speak privately?
- sir, if you do n't mind.
jackie just stopped by my office.
i think we need to take her views more into consideration.
- she's being ridiculous.
- i think she made some valid points.
who do you work for, me or her?
i'm just trying to communicate her concerns.
she'd better get in line and so had you.
i'm never gonna win if i have to spend my time explaining myself to my subordinates.
- no, no. now, freddy, sit down.
do you remember when we talked about how you treat your staff?
you want to win?
you sure as hell wo n't do it without any of them.
you keep on like this, you wo n't have any of them left.
the only brand of that i accept is unconditional.
- y'all should put this on pay -per-view.
but this sucker, i've seen him go through a rack of ribs like it was wet tissue.
- who'd you put your money on?
- she passed out giving blood.
she's okay, but, uh, mr. yates is on the line.
i'll take it in my private study.
do n't do no good calling 'a man out like that.
- could you do me a favor?
i got work to do and he needs company.
back at the ribs joint, i could just walk back in the kitchen when i got tired of hearing him talk.
i'll tell him your boss came over.
- thank you, brother.
put her on the phone with me.
she did n't want me to call, but i thought i should.
- well, is she nearby?
- i think she's embarrassed.
i'm her husband.
the nurses are with her.
maybe you should just hold off for a few minutes.
tell the head of her detail to get her on the plane right away.
she has to come back here and see the white house physician.
my guess is she'd be even more embarrassed if she had to cancel her events.
this is n't about how she feels.
this is about what's best for her.
she does n't need a doctor.
listen, just because i may have shared with you a few things about our marriage does not give you the right to interfere with it.
now, please have her call me when she's ready.
the whole world can fall apart in sixty days.
or a guy can get sober.
i washed my hands for ten minutes last night before bed.
you turned me from an alcoholic to a germaphobe.
that's not a bad trade - off.
they mean nothing compared to the last eight weeks you've been here with me.
you would have done the same for me.
i'd like to think so.
call me when you land.
jesus, you sound like sarah.
so we want to focus on ad - buys more in the quad cities market, less so in des moines.
you're stronger in the east and we want to turn our twos there into ones.
i'm sorry, what?
are you good if we change the stump to focus on the "vision" theme?
we have you going to iowa.
i know, but i want to change the schedule.
in every campaign, there comes a time for taking stock. a time for soul - searching.
if the goal is a safer, more prosperous america, i do n't need to run for us to achieve that.
all i need to do and what i encourage all of my supporters to do is to help elect heather dunbar to the white house.
yeah, i wonder what she offered her.
you knew about this?
you should call the president.
i found her in a shoebox in new york city.
oh, i was terribly scared.
- i did n't know you were coming.
she does n't either.
"so there i was, not knowing what to believe.
should i leave tina in the shoebox or set tina free? "
- leave her in the box!
- set her free!
sir, mr. grayson needs to speak with you.
- tell him i'll call him back.
- he says it's important.
i'm with my wife.
i do n't know what to do!
you should n't do anything.
man: 13th of july, 4:50 p.m.
i know that means little at this point. but i am.
and i know you knew this. in each of your ways.
it's inexcusable really, i know that now.
how it could have taken this long to admit that, i'm not sure, but it did.
i will miss you.
this is the virginia jean with an sos call.
we're riding towards absolution.
you know how far west we are?
is there a reason you're not answering my question?
he's got iron on his wrist.
he's been shot.
might be worth bounty money.
it's not your lucky day, stranger.
turn around and start walking.
i said turn around and start walking!
palms to heaven, friend.
turn around, nice and slow.
i've been shot.
only two kinds of men get shot, criminals and victims.
which one are you?
you got a name, friend?
i do n't know that either.
just what do you know?
six days a week it is.
seventh belongs to the almighty.
where'd you ride in from, son?
well, that's a big place, the west.
come on into the light here, son.
all right, this might sting a bit.
is this a mining town?
well, that was the notion.
people moved on, though.
all right now, try and hold still.
this is no gunshot.
where'd you get this, son?
i ca n't rightly absolve you of your sins if you do n't recall'em, can i?
that being said, i've seen good men do bad things and bad men do good things.
whether you're gonna end up in heaven or hell, it's not god's plan, it's your own.
you just got to remember what it was.
all right, put me a finger right here.
well, not bad for a country preacher.
it's that damn fool dolarhyde kid.
what are you doing, percy?
there's people up there!
no one's up there.
it's not fine.
it's bad enough he drinks for free.
now he has to shoot up the place?
what was that, doc?
he did n't say anything.
please, please, go back inside.
i want to hear what you said.
"it's bad enough" what?
cause if it was n't for my pa's cattle, there'd be no money going through this town!
there'd be no meat on your tables!
and your doors would be closed!
i do n't mean no disrespect to your father, percy.
but you're asking me to pay.
come here, let's settle up.
hey, kid, i do n't want any trouble.
better pick up your glasses, doc, before someone steps on them.
i'll pay the goddamn bill!
all right, son!
you know what, preacher?
you just gave me an idea.
i know it ai n't sunday, folks, but what say we take up a collection for the poor man?
now, who's got money?
now, i'm sorry doc's bad fortune has to be taken out on you good people. in the hat.
that's mighty christian of you.
you want to watch where you point that thing before you get hurt.
where the hell did he come from?
he came out of nowhere.
and he dry - gulched me.
it was n't my fault, sheriff.
damn it, percy.
you crossed the line this time.
i gotta lock you up.
you know that's not a good idea.
well, i'm afraid i got no choice, nat.
i'll tell your father about what happened today.
tell you what, ed.
next time, you can make the coffee.
why do n't you take it easy on that taos lightning, murphy?
mr. dolarhyde do n't like drinking on the job.
mr. dolarhyde do n't like drinking on the job?
i do n't care how many indians he put under neither.
you sure do flap your gums a lot when the boss ai n't around.
i'd say it to his face if he was here!
i'm gonna tell you something, boys.
money makes you soft.
where the hell's that coach?
you shot a deputy, percy.
federal marshal's bringing you to santa fe.
sheriff, have you lost your mind?
my pa is on his way down here.
you better let me out of here before things get out of hand.
sheriff, it was an accident!
it's not like i'm jesse james!
could you put that on percy's tab?
just kidding with you, there, doc.
why is there no soap in here?
why do you put the dirty dishes over here?
i like'em over here.
why do n't you rest?
i got no respect in this town.
i just did n't want you to get shot, that's all.
you want to leave?
this is your dream.
i'd follow you anywhere.
i thought it was our dream.
hey, charlie, why do n't you play something festive?
it's like a funeral in here!
what are you doing with me, anyway?
why do n't you be with somebody who can protect you?
i ca n't even protect myself.
hey, you do n't have to prove anything, okay?
i'm not a child.
on the house, for what you did.
i'm just here to drink.
my name's ella.
where'd you get your bracelet?
there something you know about me, lady?
you do n't remember anything, do you?
i know you're looking for something.
well, good luck to you.
you mind following me over to the office, so we can have us a little chat?
i think you've got the wrong man.
would n't do that if i was you.
you're in trouble now.
my pa is coming for me.
he learned how to kill a man good and slow in the war.
i am going to watch you suffer for a long, long, long time.
you thought that cheap shot in the pecker hurt?
i did n't kill your cattle.
you got to believe me!
you do n't maybe know who you're dealing with, roy.
them that did are mostly dead.
so you, ed and little mickey is picking up strays.
how many did you get?
got 24 of 'em, boss.
you been drinking, ai n't you?
i can smell it on you.
i ai n't been drinking.
it's them other two's that drinked.
you could n't do no better?
there was white lights!
there was bright lights!
so there was this big light, and you fell in the river and when you come back, two of my best hands has just disappeared.
there were n't no storm.
you do n't respect me, do you, roy?
taggart locked him up, boss.
what'd he do now?
what the hell does taggart think he's doing?
he would n't even have a job if i...
now i got to go in there and reason with him!
cause you failed to look after my boy!
everybody, saddle up.
boss, we ought to get more hands.
you're not gonna believe this, but i think jake lonergan's in town.
i'm turning you over to the federal marshal.
you're gonna tell me what i am charged with?
it says you robbed the stage last month with pat dolan and bull mccade.
which makes you accessory to every law they broke, too.
prostitute out of cottonwood grove, next county over.
you saying i killed this woman?
now, i will treat you with respect, but make no mistake,
if you try to escape, i will put a bullet in you.
taggart, what are you doing?
sheriff, this is going too far.
i was just fooling around.
look, i did n't mean to hurt anybody.
listen, i'm sorry, but i had no choice.
i could n't let you leave.
well, i'm leaving now.
you got something to say, say it.
i need to know where you came from.
you two lovebirds have a nice trip now.
taggart, let me out of here!
i have to, emmett.
it's my job.
your pa's getting things in order.
when he does he'll send for you.
it's been a year.
do n't worry, he will.
and your mom's buried here.
you know i ca n't leave my little girl.
yeah, i see them.
emmett, you go inside.
i want my boy, john.
i knew you'd come for me, pa.
i'll deal with you later.
yeah, that's lonergan, boss.
i want that man.
i ai n't going to santa fe.
you give him to me now or i'm gonna take him.
what about me, pa?
i said, shut up, boy!
they're coming back!
they're coming around again.
i can get us free.
just give me your hand.
i got you, son.
come on, get up, boss.
come on, we got to get out of here.
come on out of there!
i ca n't, pa.
what is that thing?
why are you asking me?
because you shot it!
what do you mean, you do n't know?
they took my wife.
is anyone in there?
is my wife in there?
what are you talking about?
i'm not talking about anything.
what the hell are you talking about?
you got to calm down, doc.
you're scaring the boy.
you're telling me a bunch of demons took my wife.
i did n't say any such thing.
get a hold of yourself.
you're telling me to calm down!
it went this way.
i do n't know what it is, but it's bleeding.
that's the same direction those machines went with our kin.
round up the horses, get some supplies!
we set off at first light!
i need that weapon.
it's the only thing that counts.
and i figure you owe me.
but moses was unsure, so he sent his spies into that land to survey it.
and they came back with terrible stories.
stories of evil beings, monsters the likes of which they had never seen before.
"and they were as grasshoppers in their eyes," they said.
and the people of israel became afraid.
"how can we survive against them?"
they lost their faith.
they forgot that there is nothing to fear under heaven and earth as long as we walk in the path of righteousness.
that he created man by blowing his breath into the mud, and so there is in each of us a little breath of god.
see if you can stop the bleeding.
"thou shalt not be afraid of the terrors of the night,
"nor the arrow that flieth by day,
"nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness."
god is testing us, friends.
he's testing our faith.
so we're going after our kin.
you come clean right now, or i'll kill you.
they took my people, too.
i've been looking for them a long time.
i know you can help me find them.
you stay away from me.
i can help you!
you know, some of these boys think they might already all be dead, boss.
if they wanted'em dead, they'd be dead.
they was roping 'people.
that was a round - up.
you're dead weight.
they took my wife, i'm comin '.
besides, i'm a doctor.
you stop right there.
i'm sorry, son, you ca n't go.
i'll watch him on the ride.
he can water the horses.
he ai n't got nobody.
it's heading north.
it s tracks are still fresh.
got a kid and a dog, why not a woman?
you have to take it back.
that's blood money.
well, i goddamned earned it.
by robbing and killing.
that's gonna get us what we need!
i do n't even know why we're doing this.
you know they're all dead.
well, i think if they wanted to kill them, i think they would have.
only if the boss is right and they was roping them.
bet it's to eat them.
if it was me, i'd start with your wife.
you gonna be like this the whole trip?
cause if you are, we ai n't gonna have too many long conversations, are we?
why do n't you sing a song or something?
take some friendly advice?
get yourself a gun and learn how to use it.
look who's back.
i see you, but i do n't see my gold.
let's say we find those people first, and then you can take your best shot at collecting.
maybe that reward on your head would be a more attractive proposition.
or i could just shoot you in the chest and cut that thing off your arm.
ca n't we just be happy the guy with the big gun's back?
much obliged to you, mr. lonergan.
i ai n't done nothing yet.
the tracks are washed away.
i do n't know much about boats, but i'd say that one's upside - down.
we're 500 miles from any river big enough to hold it.
i'm not going anywhere near that thing.
sleep in the rain.
how you gentlemen doin '?
thank you, deputy.
you want a seat, preacher?
you know, doc, this here is a spencer 56 - 50.
you ever shot one of these?
no time like the present.
it's a heavy gun, yeah.
i swear to god, it's raining harder in here than it is outside.
i'm soaked through.
what in the hell are we sitting around here for?
we need to be five miles and a long trot heading 'in the opposite direction of those things.
if we tried that, the old man would shoot us himself.
ai n't that right, wes?
yeah, he would.
you fixing 'to say something?
maybe we should have called in the army?
i ai n't gonna turn this over to no west pointers who got to get on the telegraph to ask washington which hand to wipe with.
i waited around at antietam for'em to tell me what to do.
i remember those stories.
i'd listen when you'd tell them to percy.
them stories were n't for you.
they were for my son.
go look after the horses.
you've been looking at this knife.
you like this knife?
you look after that.
just align your sights, and when that target peeks up over the top, just squeeze the trigger.
do n't yank on it, it's not your pecker.
you're holding onto this thing like you're hanging from it.
what the hell am i doing?
it's my fault she got took.
i never should have taken her to that town.
you'll get her back.
you're setting things right.
just got to have faith.
god's been real swell to me.
i do n't mean no disrespect, preacher, but either he ai n't up there, or he do n't like me very much.
surely you do n't expect the lord to do everything for you, do you, doc?
you got to earn his presence.
then you got to recognize it, and then you have to act on it.
now, keep your eye on the target.
there something you need?
she's the only one who knows who i am.
no, you know who you are.
you just have to remember.
i ai n't getting 'paid enough to chase dolarhyde's idiot son halfway across the country.
get away from that boy!
you got to go get our people back.
god do n't care who you were, son.
come on, boy!
it's headed north.
i ca n't find the dog.
we ai n't waiting for him.
he's run off or dead.
are n't we gonna say some words over him?
only one who knows what to say is in the ground.
ai n't it enough we took the time to put him there?
no, it's not enough.
if there is such a thing as a soul this man had a good one.
world was a better place for having him.
what are you all choked up about?
i'm worried about my grandpa.
when i was only just a little bit older than you are now all this was mexico.
word come that the apaches was riding towards a settlement called arivaca.
my father wanted me to be a man, so he made me ride out with the garrison, banging on a drum.
boy, was i scared.
well, we got there, it was too late.
they were all dead and the place was all burnt down.
this one settler fella came crawling out of a burning cabin.
he knew he was gonna die.
he rolled over, looked up into my eyes,
and he said, "kill me."
i took this knife off his belt and i slit his throat.
the tracks are closer together.
he's slowing down, headed to that can yon.
that means you, too, pretty lady.
this is what they call a hold - up.
boss, is that you?
what the hell are you doing here?
is this your new gang, jake?
i never thought i'd see you again, jake.
you were always my favorite.
did you break my tooth?
would you shut up?
how many boys we got left?
it's time to set things straight.
lay off that whiskey!
coach is on its way, and we best damn be sober for it.
how much dynamite we get?
you got some balls riding back in here like nothing ever happened.
boys are n't going anywhere with you, jake.
we're fixing to rob us a coach.
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.
you watch your mouth.
i run this outfit now.
if he so much as twitches, blow her brains out of her ear.
you ai n't in no position to make threats, boyo.
hunt, take his gun.
where's our gold, jake?
well, i do remember you telling us you was leaving us high and dry because of some woman.
i guess you just left out the part about taking all our gold from that last job, huh?
so i'm gonna ask you one last time.
where is it, jake?
demons took your gold.
when you get to hell you can ask for it back.
i told you not to call her that.
i said drop'em!
not fun, is it?
you know, that was n't very nice.
do n't forget your gun.
you'll always be my favorite.
i do n't want to do that again.
hey, you stay with me.
you remember now, do n't you?
all i know is i owe it to her to find her.
it's not far now.
you and me, we're gonna be just fine.
give her to me, nat.
give it to her.
she's gone, pal.
no, she's not gone.
the last of his people.
there's no reasoning with them.
we're all gonna die anyway.
this is what's left of the chiricahuas.
he's saying the white people, they brought all this evil to his people.
you're the evil one!
he's saying we brought the monsters.
we did n't bring the monsters.
tell him they took our people, too!
there's no reasoning with them!
tell him what i said, nat!
i'm sorry, but i could n't tell you.
are you one of them?
i'm from a different place.
i took this form so i could walk among you.
i did n't know if i could heal this body, if i would wake up.
he wants to know where you're from.
what'd she say?
she says she came from a place above the stars.
he says you should n't talk.
what do you mean i should n't talk?
you're a guest of the chief.
now i'm a guest?
i thought i was a prisoner!
you're both big men!
can we listen to the woman tell her story?
or whatever she is?
what are they doing here?
well, that's just ridiculous.
what are they gonna do, buy something?
it's as rare to them as it is to you.
what about my grandpa?
what about my wife?
what about the other people?
are they still alive?
if they are, they wo n't be for long.
if we let them leave, they'll come back with more and there will be no survivors.
that's what they did to my people.
i came here to make sure it would not happen again, but we have to work together.
he says his people will join her.
what's she going to do?
we can find them.
he knows where they are.
i ca n't remember anything.
i could n't even remember my own name.
he says they will take care of that.
i brought the gold.
that's why she died.
how did they build something like that?
they arrived in it.
it's their vessel.
that's only the top.
the rest is underground.
it's how they mine for gold.
so there is gold here.
can they see out of there?
they do n't see well in daylight.
they stay underground in caverns where it's dark.
we'll never even get close.
those flying machines will just pick us off before we get anywhere near it.
there is another way in.
the way i came out.
we got to get those creatures out of there and out in the open, where we can get at them.
so you can go in with that arm gun, get our people out.
we have one advantage, they underestimate you.
you're like insects to them.
they're not planning on defending themselves, so they'll be vulnerable.
we have n't got enough men.
this ai n't gonna work.
he says he wants to use your spyglass.
the apaches are mountain warriors.
he says it's better to fight from high ground.
tell him he's a fool.
there is no high ground while they got those flying machines.
how much gold we had left?
it's about 1 ,000.
i run this gang now.
now, you might be in charge, but some of that gold's mine, fair.
after what we saw yesterday, i'm gonna need every little bit of it i can to get as far away from here as i can.
the gold goes where i go.
i got'em, bull.
you ai n't going anywhere.
you planning a trip?
we're going as far away as we can go.
you remember la playa in puerto vallarta?
they got good fishing.
it's not far enough.
what the hell were those things, jake?
they're gonna find us and they're gonna wipe us out.
what i'm saying is you got a choice.
you can drink your last few hours away on a beach, which by the way, is not a bad idea
or you can follow me one last time.
why the hell would we do that?
same reason you always have, bull.
i'll make you rich.
listen to me, damn it!
he does n't understand tactics.
you got to explain to him.
look, we ca n't just run around hollering and throwing spears and shooting arrows at the damn thing.
we got to draw them out of there onto open ground where we can surround them, attack them on all sides.
he said he's not going to let you lead his people.
he's saying they need to open their hearts and see in you what he has seen.
that his parents died in the mexican war and you took him in when he was only a boy.
taught him how to take care of himself even though you were not blood.
that you despise battle but would never run from it.
that you're a fierce warrior worthy of any fight.
he says if you're such a great warrior, why do you only have a man and a boy to follow you into battle?
you should n't be here.
a lady, a wife?
my wife, you know, she's a mexicano.
i'm not gonna be here very long.
none of us are here very long.
do n't ever do that to me again.
i do n't know what we're going to do.
demons are coming out.
go up where i showed you.
you see our people, wave your arms.
if your people are in there, i'll get them out.
this is how they get the gold out.
how bad is it, doc?
compadre, you'll be all right.
maybe not point the gun at me.
put some weight and see how it feels.
they're not going down!
keep at it till we get our people out!
doc, get down here!
i always dreamed of riding into battle with you.
i always dreamed of having a son like you.
do n't look into the light.
i told you not to look into the light.
each one's different.
you'd better hurry.
there's more of them coming!
i came here to destroy that thing.
wait, i ca n't take it off.
you can control it.
same way you shoot it.
you have to stop thinking.
if i can get it to its core, i can stop them.
good - bye, jake.
they're coming out the other side!
what about jake and ella?
you all right, old man?
she's still inside.
you're all grown up.
do n't you remember me, boy?
i do n't remember much.
i thought you were dead.
how many more songs we gotta listen to before we get another drink?
hey, simmer down there, cowboy!
one more shot of whiskey right here.
what do you got there?
this ai n't wells fargo.
i need some coin.
doc, a drink for me and my friend here.
ai n't he a little young?
what, after what he's been through, doc?
two sarsaparillas, please!
and this should take care of any outstanding debt.
yes, comin', pa.
next round's on the dolarhydes.
all this gold's gonna make things different.
we're gonna have a railroad in here soon.
that'll change the cattle business.
run these ledgers back to the bank for me, will you?
tell them i need some new checks.
i want the new ones to read "dolarhyde and son."
that sound good to you?
you were n't gonna leave without saying good - bye, were you?
i'm a wanted man.
i could have sworn i saw jake lonergan die in those caves, did n't you, sheriff?
i was looking forward to hanging him myself.
i could use a good man around here.
she's in a better place.
i'll see you around, colonel.
- what are you talking about?
areyousure youwantto do this?
the signal will be better outside.
- hands in the air!
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
hello, usman. ican helpyou.
and i do n' thaveany friends.
can i get in there?
i have this room at 4:00!
i know you do n't get a lot of news downstairs, zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
we've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
right, but talking, though, sir, not... he's not doing anything.
is n't that the point?
hey, tim. how's it going?
you celebrating something, nate?
you seeing someone special, huh?
genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
the crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
these containers carried cesium - 137.
it's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
when we tracked the shipment back to baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
so there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
if that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the d.c. area.
uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from north africa.
so the guys on four, they put together this map.
it's an analysis of muslim communities in dc, maryland and virginia, along with their countries of origin.
we'd like each -- yes?
what about leads on the dt front?
well, given the cesium came from north africa, we do n't think domestic is really in the picture.
the last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on us soil was james cummings.
he was a white supremacist living in maine, he was going to set it off at obama's inauguration.
he had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
i'm sure you're familiar with the case.
it goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
- i'm angela zamparo.
you got a couple minutes?
nicorette just is n't the same.
you seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
you remember oklahoma city?
well, yeah, i guess i was five, but sure.
what do you know about timothy mcveigh?
ah... he was some kind of lone extremist in a militia?
do n't be an asshole who bullshits questions you do n't know the answer to.
timothy mcveigh was a decorated gulf war veteran.
he was a white supremacist, following a plan.
- a plan from a book called the turner diaries.
it's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, jews, and "mud people."
you know how the war gets started?
the hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
timothy mcveigh was reenacting that scene from the turner diaries.
he was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
what he was trying to do was start the race war.
you're focused on the islamic guys. i get it.
we all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
we see what we want to see.
but just because you're not looking at something does n't mean it's not there.
so, why are you telling me this?
i'm talking about a blood andguts, in thestreet, killorbe killedracewar.
he gets 20,000 listeners a night.
we believe he's based just outside of dc, but almost nobody knows him personally.
but i have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
and the leader of that gang is friends with wolf.
so i need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
right and i'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
i barely passed the pft!
what do you think undercover work is?
beating guys up and shooting at them?
no, it's people skills. it's controlling situations.
this is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
i saw you with that muslim kid. you got most of this going on anyway.
high iq, great people skills, but not your typical fbi profile.
introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
fine, but i'm trying to tell you, i do n't have the skills for this!
i ca n't even defend myself!
you do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
what did you say to that kid?
"you want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."
now some of these things havea half - life of 30 years.
do you know how management looks at undercover, nate?
you think this office is bad?
i just want to discuss the option, sir.
of what, of killing your whole career?
they slit your throat, and they pull your tongue right out through it?
oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
you're just trying to manipulate him!
and you're not?
but you better think long and hard about this.
larry ford, developing typhoid and cholera.
i could go on like this for hours.
i was in the marines for three years, on a wmd squad in iraq.
but i saw a lot of things over there that changed me.
and i'm starting to wonder...
but i wantto be oneofthem.
and i want to make a difference.
okay. not bad. what else?
if you get yourself in a situation where you have to show somebody your dd - 214, then you're already done.
good. now what else?
so what do they want from you?
i'm loyal, i'm dedicated to the the cause.
no. any thug can be loyal.
what the guys with the cesium... are gonna want?
welcome to medvale medical supply company.
my military contacts helped me start this business.
most of our sales are online.
our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
so we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
he's in a gang called the panzer strikeforce, and the leader of the gang is this guy.
he's friends with dallas wolf.
so vince and dallas wolf are tight?
yeah, i told you, vince calls into wolf's show every week.
yougetcloseto vince. then, youusehim togetto knowwolf.
this is my friend nate i was telling you about.
all right, spread'em.
roy does our security.
hey, are you a cop?
sorry about that, nate.
but you know how it is.
- yeah, absolutely.
- whoa, whoa.
frank tells me you were in iraq.
uh, yeah, three years in the corps.
- you kill anybody?
he's johnny. he's a fresh cut.
we're trying to teach him the ropes.
i do n't talk about that.
but what i did see was a lot of our guys go down.
so then i get home, i started listening to dallas wolf.
dallas and i go way back.
he's somebody who's telling the truth.
he's out there, he's asking why were we there?
and the answer's always the same.
iraq, 9 11, osama bin laden, what does it all come back to?
how many white men slaughtered their brothers in world war ii?
who's always pulling the strings?
it's all here in front of us.
but most people are blind.
look at this bottle.
you see anything funny?
you're talking about the jew tax?
tell'em, nate.
start looking at the food you buy, and you'll see this little "u."
the union of orthodox rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
for this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
we ca n't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
that's how it went down in germany.
and we think of ourselves as a sturm abteilung.
we are a thinking man's soldiers.
and that is where the revolution starts.
we're not these tired old kkk guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- we're the catastrophe.
and we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
well, always room to improve, though, right?
well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- the point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
no, we're ready for whatever goes down.
yeah, with only you and him, i do n't know your name yet, i'm sorry, carrying?
when you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
you spend three years in iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
now i only got one question for you.
why are you wearing levis?
yeah, no, sorry, i just could n't help notice when i was patting 'you down.
while you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
so why are you wearing them?
because when i got home from iraq, my brother gave me these jeans... as a homecoming gift.
now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
you wanna boycott the jews?
you ever look at the fortune 500?
frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
i'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
you know, when i was 13, i actually played soccer.
one day, i came into the locker room, right?
his head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
i mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
i'd never seen anyone get beaten like that.
and when i came in, they just stared at me.
they stared, and i...
and just left him.
yeah, when i was your age, i got pushed around a lot.
but you can use that.
i learned to be proud.
is n't that right, johnny?
all right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
hey, nate, you know what, man?
is n'tthatright, johnny?
you did n't hear me?
yeah, come on in.
it's a mess, sorry.
yeah, but it kind of looks like you just moved in.
so, what are you guys doing here?
aw, do n't break my heart.
what are we doing here?
come on, do n't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
see vince is outside. he's got a little surprise for you.
cool, well, i'm good to go.
- let's go, roy.
- what's the rush?
- all right, you ready?
yeah, i know, i'llget toit.
you make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
sometimes, angela, it would just be great to hear, "good job."
i'm only so hard on you because i'm trying to protect you.
you have to remember your objective here.
so what do i do about that?
try relating to these guys as human beings. you know?
open up to them, if you can.
you may have more in common with them than you think.
hey, that looks good on you, man.
um, just go in, i got another shirt in the cargo.
hi, you must be vince's friend nate!
- i'm becky, gerry's wife.
- such a pleasure to have you.
- thank you for having me.
hey, nate, i made some cupcakes.
the frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
come check this out.
john, canwe getthe graphic?
they'rebusingin hundreds of protestors from the dc area.
because while we come in peace, we'recertainly notafraidof war.
god, that's the first i'm hearing about this rally.
i mean, god knows you ca n't get any real news on the yidivision, but still...
are you planning on going, nathan?
and this is andrew blackwell from the aryan alliance.
- hail victory, brother.
the aryan alliance, huh?
i've read a lot about you guys.
well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so that's not surprising.
earnest walton, grand dragon, good to meet you.
earnest is with the local klan.
yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
you should check out our website, too.
we're always looking for quality people.
ah, i do n't think nate's into all that religious stuff.
i just think nate is a little more rational than that.
come on, nate. let's go back and get some food.
stay away from those faggots.
jews invented the printing press, and the bible is the most published book in the world.
i mean, anything seem off to you?
how about the fact the romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
you gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
you're with us.
- it's two hours, be good.
gerry, there's somebody i want you to meet. this is nate.
- hey, gerry conway.
- nate thomas, nice to meet you.
vince told me all about you.
make yourself at home. i am throwing on some veggie burgers.
- hey, hey, i'm nate.
- madeline. nice to meet you.
- hey, madeline.
- this is timmy.
- hey, timmy.
you want to come see our tree house?
uh, yeah, sure, where are we going?
oh, right, yeah, there.
oh, wow, that is great!
did your dad build this?
- i built it!
- you built this?
- but my daddy helped.
- it's to protect us.
- yeah, from what?
if the mud people come.
always be ready. always be watchful and stick together.
you guys kidnapping my guest?
this is amazing, man.
well, i've always been good with my hands.
you know how you spell love, nate?
ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12. - wow.
you been in the movement long, nate?
um, not long. just since i got back from iraq.
yeah, vince told me you served. - mm-hm.
um, what about you?
you seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
ah, they probably come for the free food.
yeah, as much as i can, yes, you know, i try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be healthy in body and spirit.
it makes me so sad to see those two.
they gotta clean up their act.
well, how do you mean?
well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
to be honest, now that i met you, i'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
well, you ca n't exclude them.
i mean, they're the next generation.
need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
what kind of a world will they grow up in?
no, no, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
we're aryan warriors, right?
hey, you two!
hold on, what did you say?
they get the point.
you thought you were a big man, huh?
he gets it, roy!
i thought you were a big man.
- come on, let's go!
yeah, i think they got the message, roy!
man, those two were mine!
that was n't an accident, was it?
was it, nate?
you wanted them to get away.
okay, you're goddamn right i wanted them to get away!
you think about security cameras, roy?
you think about the liquor store we were just in?
anaccountant, aschool teacher, a lawyer, fireman, he'sanengineer, not a criminal record in sight, butandrewblackwell, he's a differentstory.
uh, he said he was going to wolf's rally.
he's the national director of the aryan alliance.
they're based in ohio, he would n't just come all this way to be in a rally.
wait, if wolf is involved in this, he ca n't be doing it alone, right?
i mean, he'd need help, and organization.
exactly, so you need to figure out how wolf and blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
vince, good to see you.
rich, can we get some literature, please?
can everyone take a seat?
if you take millions of white people, and flood every country in africa with them, what do they call that?
but what's happening to every white country on earth?
you've got affirmative action that kills white jobs.
abortion, that kills white babies.
gay rights, that kill white families.
folks, let me explain something to you.
"diversity" is a code word. and what it means is white genocide!
this is not the order that we agreed to.
now just a second, andrew.
you know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the colonial patriots.
well, this is n't "every year," is it?
to be fair, harris, maybe we should.
vince, can you introduce me to dallas?
you're the "invisible white knights" of the ku klux klan!
i want to introduce you to my good friend, this is nate thomas.
- uh, mr. wolf?
- yes, what is it?
i did n't want to get into this in front of vince, but i'd like to talk to you about an investment.
i represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- is that so?
- yes, sir.
they have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
they want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you ca n't go nationwide.
well, that is great, son.
here, call this number and we'll talk.
okay, great. that sounds great, mr. wolf.
- call me, dallas.
we're here today because we're proud of our race!
we love our race!
and we're here to say that.
the white race is under attack in this country.
but nobody seems to give a damn!
where's jesse jackson to fight for white rights!
if you're white, and you are standing over there...
... you're on the wrong side of that barricade!
wake up, white people!
it's morning in america and there's a new day coming.
what are you doing, man?
come join your race!
come join the white race!
- i gotta help him.
get your hands off of me!
andrew, can you walk?
i brought you some chamomile tea. it'll help you relax.
there's our wounded warrior.
how you feeling, buddy?
yeah, much better.
ah, no problem.
i'm gonna put some music on.
i brought you sammy to keep you company.
i... i love brahms.
see, becky, i knew he was quality.
i think the fourth is my favorite.
yeah, mine, too.
except maybe the -- the first?
now listen, if you like brahms, i've got this clarinet quintet that will blow your mind.
they're dead, gerry.
that's why i avoid the political stuff.
besides, i've heard it can be dangerous.
i thought you guys were vegetarians.
what's "vices"?
oh, boy, there we go!
i'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
gerry, becky, thanks for everything.
nathan, i do n't know what to say.
i owe you, big time.
why do n't you stop by the compound some time.
got ta go with bernstein.
listen, i ca n't help it, he's a great conductor.
jews listen to wagner, do n't they?
so, gerry, if you do n't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
listen, for me, it was the books.
my parents were practically liberals.
it all started with this.
read it in four days.
it explains race, culture, capitalism and how democracy destroyed western civilization.
"three people form a government. then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- you can bring it back.
- oh, no, i could n't.
nate, nate, please.
but that was it?
i mean, it was just books woke you up?
well, you know, i had my theories.
and then a three - month engineering contract opened up in kenya.
i was young, i wanted to see the world.
and, uh, nate, listen,
i got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
but if you go there, and you see, they were n't even living like animals.
you know, animals do n't live in their own feces, do they?
so, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
so, howwasthe brahms?
"openupto them?" you said.
he was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
and he kept insisting i go to this club with him, where i knew he was gonna make his big move, but if i did n't go, then, you know, i could blow my whole cover.
so we're at a bar, and i tell him i want oysters.
so i get a dozen, i start plowing through them.
then i start acting queasy.
i run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
so now there's puke all over my dress,
i tell him i got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
two days later, he was arrested.
but there was the thrill, you know?
yeah, so why'd you stop?
it was just it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
and i wanted to spend more time with my kids.
you do n't think i'm mommy material?
no, no... no.
yeah, i got two princesses.
perfect, little suburban life.
but the case wo n't go forever.
you ca n't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
nathan, good to see you.
can we get you anything, coffee?
oh, no, i'm good, thanks.
this is a great set - up you got here.
all right, let's give you the tour.
this parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
how are you handling that?
well, we tell them we're here to stay.
make no mistake about it. we show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
so you're moving the national headquarters?
no, we're keeping the compound in ohio, it's just with everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
- is that your firing range?
- yeah, come on.
i'm no marksman, by any means, but i have some expertise in range design, just from training the iraqi police.
what's your danger area template?
to contain your cone of fire.
i mean, how do you control your overshoot?
we have n't gotten to that yet.
maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
i need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but i'm happy to.
uh, come on up here.
- are those cots?
we'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
you see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, nathan.
educated, war veteran, clean record.
yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
and so what's the overall objective here?
i mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
what would we do with them?
they're at home sitting on their asses, - watching sitcoms and surfing facebook.
this is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
look, i'm flattered by the interest, but, you know, i've been around the movement awhile now and a lot of these guys are all talk.
now for me to really want to get involved, i need to know there's bigger things going on here.
yeah... none taken.
this is the entire dc water system.
plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
now, nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
we got no use for them.
we need men like you.
i'm looking for dallas wolf, but i must have the wrong house.
oh, no, he's here.
the studio's back here.
i'm moving studios right now, so this is all temporary.
thanks for taking the time to see me, dallas.
i just spent the afternoon with andrew at the aryan alliance.
they have an incredible organization.
yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
about doing whatever it takes.
they're true patriots, those guys.
well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
i was in iraq for three years, on a wmd squad.
and then when i got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
wow, this is great.
yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to x-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
and with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
yes, i've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
that's exactly what i need.
so how do i meet him?
but he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
funny you should mention that.
i've been trying to raise 7,500 to break into the florida market.
they're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
so for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
nate, i've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
what i need is the right people behind me.
so you tell your investor that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
the whole case is about to blow wide open!
he's in with wolf, he's in with the aryan alliance.
let me get this straight. so after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for 7,500 as an "investment" in this guy's radio show?
oh, yeah, i'm just flush with cash!
sir, the alliance is building a compound outside dc.
wolf's house is setting off a geiger counter!
i spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
when's the last time you cleaned this?
i've been meaning to get to most of them.
okay, guys, seriously!
we need to go through the whole inventory.
andrew's waiting on this.
i'm gonna have to tell andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
you get on the phone yourself!
call them up and ask them...
it's been a while.
yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
i'm sorry about that, vince.
yeah, i bet you have.
thanks for stopping by.
be seeing you, nate.
what was that all about?
roy says the police have been following him.
have you seen how that guy behaves?
it's a miracle he's not in jail already.
sure, what's up?
i'm throwing a youth event for hitler's birthday.
there's a campground a couple miles from here.
- help us scout it.
it's amazing how much land there is right outside dc.
let me ask you something, nathan.
what's your opinion on infiltration?
how do we prevent it?
well, it's tough.
for one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
maybe we should make everybody take it.
i mean, i think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
yeah, i mean, for informants, that might work.
do you suspect someone?
you know, it's like they say at these rallies.
you look to the left, look to the right, one of these people is a snitch.
turn left right up here.
you okay there, nate?
you look a little off?
just, uh, tired...
been a long day.
well, i think this is a great location.
yeah, i like it.
we tell them we're a christian organization, holding a youth event.
i gotta ask you something.
said there's no record of you having served in the marines.
i was on a wmd squad, so that's black ops.
wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
what if he was n't convinced? what if he calls wolf?
you do n't know if he was convinced!
you do n't even know if they talk, okay?
you're being -- yeah, i'd like 7,500 in cash.
you're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
so, listen, dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
oh, okay, i think it was all in the presentation, but we start with online in tampa, and then we move down the - no, no, i mean, beyond that.
beyond the show, like what we talked about.
the actions we're gonna take.
i'm sorry, nate. i lost you.
bigger than oklahoma city, bigger than 9 11 -- oh, yeah, for sure.
which is why expanding the show is so important.
he told me you'd been working together.
well, yeah, sure, i mean, he came to the rally.
no, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
as i said to you before, i have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
i thought we were talking about expanding the show.
yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
okay, nate, fair enough.
sorry it did n't work out.
i saw the plans, dallas, for the water system.
andrew showed them to me, okay?
so, i know all about it, and now i just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
this is private property.
you're no longer welcome here.
i'm asking you to leave.
i'm on your side.
i did n't know you'd be here.
has anyone talked to him?
no, it's your show.
so, dallas. or should i call you randy?
that is your real name.
you can call me whatever you like, agent zamparo.
any reason you're using an assumed name?
i'm a public entertainer.
i'm here because of the guy i called about.
he shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
did he give you money?
that's a lot.
- why would he do that?
- because he's a wacko!
no, agent zamparo, i do n't.
i have information about a truck accident outside dc last night, involving classified radio active material, but now the fbi is trying to cover it all up.
you've gotta be kidding me.
it's a radio show.
so you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
why do n't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
brandenburg vs ohio, 1969, it is not illegal to advocate violence.
the first amendment does n't protect people who have knowledge of an actual crime!
what knowledge of a crime do i have?
well, why do n't you tell me, randy?
what is this accident?
what is this fbi cover - up?
why are you living at an unregistered address?
and why is that location lighting up a geiger counter?
you've been following me?
you've been casing my house?
why do n't you answer my questions?
so what is the zog covering up? "
as for the unregistered address, i live with my mom, and i'd like to keep that private, if it's okay with you?
i'm an entertainer. i do this for money, and for fun.
can you open the door, please?
i warned you, i tried to tell you.
- we still might have a weapons case!
- we ran those serial numbers.
every single one of those guns is legally registered.
okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
the barracks for 200 guys?
- the water system plans?
it's all talk! he keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
what are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
you know, we see what we want to see!
this happens sometimes, you know?
- i mean, it sucks, but
it's the nature of the work.
this... this happened because of your pet theory!
and like an idiot, i we nt along with it!
"oh, yeah, she's an expert," i thought.
"she knows what she's doing!"
this has been great for you!
you got the thrill back! you got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- no, that is not fair!
i thought we had a case!
god, do you even know how many dead ends i've been down?
you knew i was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that i would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
hey, good to see you!
i've been calling you!
i just wanted to return these.
uh, that's nice of you, but i do n't think i can.
aw, come on, just for a cup of tea?
is everything okay, nate?
yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
well, you said you're headed out west.
god, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
but then, i listen to something like that.
we all have that power, nate.
honestly... i used to feel that way, gerry.
i always felt like i could change the world.
you know, i could right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
yeah, i just keep thinking about that quote.
"for evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
- i'm just really tired.
you know, nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
that's not how the change is gonna come.
it's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
let's go out back.
i made some improvements to the tree house.
talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
you know, i've thinking about this for a long time, nate, years really.
what's needed is an event.
an event that wakes people up.
they're sleepwalkers out there.
think about this regime.
media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, waco, ruby ridge.
that's how it all starts.
all the lies that the zionists tell about nazi germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
the irony of it! right?
because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
yes, you get it!
yeah, look at the sons of liberty.
that is how you start a revolution.
yeah, yeah, i always felt this kinship with you, nate.
i want to make a difference.
i still got connections from my africa days.
okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
but, nate, if you get involved we may not live to see the world we're building.
but i'll have helped to build it.
a man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
there's a way you can help us.
we need to talk to the s.a.c., now!
oh, my lord, who the hell wrapped it?
sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- okay, one, two...
- hey, morgan, david...
i want you to meet somebody.
morgan, good to meet you.
- greetings, sir. i'm david.
so is the wedding out here?
yeah, it's right over here.
wait till we see it all lit up.
pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
may their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
if you trust me, you can trust him.
no one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
if we give up that prepaid phone crap, i use my real name, i got three guys i can get it from right now.
if we do it the morning of -- yeah, i thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
guys, guys, shh. nate has a potential solution for us.
a smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
i run a medical supply company.
and you're gonna get tatp?
i know it's not the easiest thing, but i've got some connections.
assuming i can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
ready when we need it.
no, i mean, how are we going to handle it?
no... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- well, what do you suggest?
- i think we need suits.
they'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
if you can get the tatp, sunday is our day.
you guys remember timothy mcveigh's last words?
"it matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
are you sure this is gonna look right?
wow. it looks great.
the secret is the smell.
where's the bleach powder?
yeah, that's why terrorists love tatp.
you ca n't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
okay, if you say so.
look, can i just say i'm sorry about what i said to you the other day.
that's what this job does to you.
keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
it's totally secure.
we can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
and here is the tatp.
- nope. all good.
morgan's a pharmacist.
hm, these crystals seem a little small.
okay, let's test it.
you got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
hold on, what do you mean?
it burns for a while before it explodes.
i saw it on youtube.
do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
hey, you are not the only one with experience!
this is a highly unstable substance, okay?
it's sensitive to heat, friction -- which is why i'll do the test carefully!
now you want to see the video?
we are not lighting this stuff on fire!
you know how many bomb techs i saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in iraq?
i've worked with this company for two years!
they are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
you want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
so, can we see the suits?
you guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
and now they're all at gerry's.
but it's saturday?
and why do they need ammonium nitrate?
i do n't know. me and hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at gerry's now.
no! you can not raid them yet!
you do n't even know if they have the cesium?
and gerry's phone's off.
okay, i have to go over there.
- what are you doing here?
- i was calling, you did n't answer. i got worried.
- i just told you!
i'm gonna give you one more chance.
i called three times, you did n't answer any of them!
i got worried something happened to you!
all right, put it down!
he's telling the truth!
- yes! i was worried, so i was checking constantly!
okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
i sent david to do surveillance on your shop last night.
i saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- in the middle of the night?
could there be like a power problem?
no, they must have traced the tatp you ordered.
- okay, if they're on to the shop
they're on to you.
are you sure you were n't followed?
- if he said he was n't, he was n't!
morgan, get back to work, please, jesus.
we had to move forward, immediately.
and you were n't gonna let me know?
nate, i'm sorry.
it's too risky.
well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
what about the tatp?
david got ammonium nitrate instead.
he used his name, so the jig is up.
they'll know it's us.
it's not gonna matter tomorrow.
we're in this to the end now, nate.
they're not gonna take us alive.
all right, let me help.
i should go wash up so i do n't contaminate anything.
hey, nate! how are you?
- the cesium is here!
angela, you have to tell him to wait.
there are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
this is a residential neighborhood.
his wife and kids are in the house.
this is a volatile situation.
no, he does n't get it!
these guys are fanatics!
they will not be taken alive!
tom, you're not in there!
we have to listen to him.
okay, let's get these suits ready.
okay, let's get ready to move!
we are almost done here!
come on, help me!
- come on, get your hood on!
come on, get up!
can you believe it?
yeah, i'm gonna miss it here, though.
"this should have been a noble creature"
yeah, gerry, and all of them, really.
yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
why do you think i picked you?
i knew that you would understand them.
and they'd understand you.
and the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
i blamed those black kids, and i blamed this school, i blamed the cops;
i was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
i look at you guys and i see myself.
but you guys do n't have to make the same mistakes i did.
you do n't have to be victims.
thanks for coming by.
i'm so proud of you, johnny.
you know what they say...
it all begins with the word.
climate controlled stacks, energy efficient, now mind you the whole collection could probably fit on a kindle, but at least the cadets will have another place to get out of the rain.
did you have much input on the design?
i approved the blue prints.
if something's gonna have my name on it, i want to make damn sure they build it right.
i think my husband fancies himself a bit of an architect.
well, jefferson designed monticello...
luckily i do n't have any, so that particular temptation has n't presented itself.
the sentinel, south carolina's premiere military college.
they taught me the values of honor, duty and respect.
they also hazed me, tried to break me, and senior year, nearly expelled me when i volunteered for a senate race and my studies suffered.
but that did n't stop them from soliciting a hefty sum for their new library 30 years later.
how quickly poor grades are forgotten in the shadow of power and wealth.
your drink is only about half as full as it should be, frank.
are you trying to get me drunk?
drunk, passed out in the gutter so i can steal your wife.
did you get the email about the riflemen?
from my office. about the invitations.
i was hoping they would be here.
i'll check the list, but i do n't remember any email...
in fact, here's how you can make it up to me, freshen my drink.
that i can do.
remy, nice to see you here.
gerry and all the folks at sancorp give you their regards.
she's here somewhere, fending off admirers.
sancorp was very disappointed she turned down their donation.
and they're also concerned about peter russo running for governor.
now, how do you know about that?
three - quarters of pennsylvania sits on top of the marcellus shale.
if i ca n't find out who's running for governor, i do n't deserve a dime of what they're paying me.
this watershed bill russo sponsors places a lot of restrictions on drilling...
remy, congress is in recess and this weekend is not about work.
i apologize, you are absolutely right.
but my other clients did n't pay for your library, or my plane ticket down here.
yes, nice little junket for you.
i do hope you're taking in the sights.
this is n't my first trip to charleston.
but i'll bet it's your first time not as my press secretary.
who else you have coming in?
i did n't want to pack tonight too much.
you know, these receptions are usually just for the money people, like yourself.
but i'm gonna save that for my big speech tomorrow, and that way i'm not gonna bore y'all to tears twice.
frank underwood exemplifies all the virtues we try to instill in our graduates.
we're so proud to call you an alumnus, frank, and to have your name as a permanent fixture on our campus.
thank you, president higgins.
i first want to thank sancorp industries for providing the funds to make the library possible.
when i matriculated here as a young cadet,
jimmy carter had just been elected president.
after i graduated, i wished that i could have had another four years, just like jimmy.
well, neither of us got our wish, but i left this campus with fond memories.
i got your damn email.
how long has that light been like that?
a month, maybe.
and nobody's come to fix it?
nobody do n't fix nothing around here.
now it's too dark.
i'm running for governor.
that's why i came up to philly.
there's a community meeting tomorrow.
i'm gonna talk to the shipbuilders about a plan to bring their jobs back, so they support me in the election.
i do n't know nothing about that stuff.
okay, listen, there's gonna be some stories coming out about me, in the news, about my past.
i just wanted to give you a heads up, so it does n't catch you off guard.
i do n't watch the news no more.
you want to see some pictures of kevin and sarah?
too dark to look at pictures.
no, no, it's on my phone, you do n't need any light.
get it away from me.
i hate those things.
and gluckenheimer, what he did...
"well, you look lovely today, mrs. governor."
and the thing took a dump.
you can get a cow up three flights of stairs, but you ca n't get it down!
and that's why in the end he said, "who wants steak for dinner?"
how are you boys doing?
- you think i'm fat?
seriously, phil here thinks i got fat with old age.
you're a big man with an even bigger heart.
i love this woman.
do n't let him get into too much trouble.
they'll have grounds for impeachment when we're done with him.
we better get another drink before they close up.
you're gonna be the waiter tonight.
hold on a second there, partner.
you had no idea we were coming?
i thought higgins might've...
no, he played it perfectly.
made me think you were n't coming at all.
we would n't have missed it for the world.
on the library, are they gonna put frank or francis?
francis is better for libraries.
i got a few of those.
does anybody ever actually call you francis?
she's the only one.
she seems like a real prize.
bar was already shut down, but look what i scored.
paul, did you invite him here?
did you ask him here after we said all those times that we're not gonna let him bother you?
he screwed you over one too many times.
who you talking about?
i'm talking about peter russo at the front door.
did you ask him here, or did he just come on his own?
no, i'm not gonna stop until you actually deal with it and get rid of him.
paul, you got a minute to talk?
there's nothing to talk about.
and i want to talk about the shipyard.
i got a plan to fix it.
you do n't want everything going into the roth ira.
five, ten grand a year, and i'll set you up with a nice diversified package, low risk, high yield.
i think claire and i have things pretty well under control.
if i brought a senior u.s. congressman into the fund, that would really up my stock in the company.
what're you all gabbing about back there?
we were talking about the old library.
yeah, what's happening to it?
they gonna tear it down?
they could gut it, they could turn it into a student center.
hey, we should sneak in there.
what the hell, why not?
the association had about 3 million saved up in reserve for emergencies.
but you split that up between 12,000 members, it's nothing.
couple weeks' groceries.
major federal funds going towards public parks, green commercial spaces, cleaning up waste sites.
that's construction jobs, park management, retail...
that's not even half...
it's a start.
a year, maybe two...
what're we supposed to do until then?
listen, there's a community meeting tomorrow...
you gonna be there?
i was n't planning on it.
i'd like you to be there.
you want me to vouch for you?
listen, i'm gonna tell you something that only a handful of people know.
i'm running for governor.
now i know i let you down with the shipyard, but if i win the governor's race i can get everything back on track.
you show up on my doorstep asking for my forgiveness, and now you want me to be your lapdog?
okay, this watershed bill is just the beginning.
if i'm governor, there's so much i can do.
you just want to use me.
yeah, it's exactly like that.
i did n't realize you and frank were staying here.
we always stay here when we're in charleston.
you know that, remy.
i promise it was a coincidence.
my assistant booked it.
he's off cavorting with his old classmates. hmm.
you want to sit down and have a drink?
they booked me the bridal suite.
there's champagne on ice...
my, my, you've grown very confident since you worked for francis.
i've always been confident, claire.
you never would've invited me upstairs.
the staff always stayed in the best western four blocks away.
good night, remy.
the bridal suite's on the top floor, at the end of the hallway, if you change your mind.
good night, claire.
hey, kenny, i think you got a little too big for this.
i think the hole got a lot smaller.
do n't let a little girth stop you.
yeah, look, it's still there.
wow, look at that.
good, and you?
i'm in charleston, actually.
i thought i'd surprise you.
come on, let me show you where i went through puberty.
i can totally see you here at 16.
got in some trouble on this bed, huh?
which is what my mother told me, in her own special way.
am i gonna meet her?
you do n't want to meet her.
i just want to stop by, say hey, see her face.
i'm officially convinced that you're the most amazing woman i've ever been with.
but i meant it when i said i wanted to take this trip alone.
which is why i came.
to be here for you. moral support.
i know these people, they're going to lay into me big time.
tomorrow's an important day for the campaign.
do n't fight me on this.
so do i get a hotel?
a hotel would be more comfortable.
but it would be a waste of valuable campaign funds.
you see that crack up in the ceiling?
i know every inch and curve.
i'm scared of the dark!
let there be light!
how come you and frank have never had kids?
you've never had kids.
yeah, but i'm not married.
we just decided not to.
there was n't some big conversation.
i think you're lying.
think whatever you want.
i mean, yeah, maybe once or twice.
i mean, i do n't feel there's some void.
i'm perfectly happy without.
can you imagine me wiping a baby's ass and changing nappies?
no, i ca n't.
actually, yes, i just did, i'm going to have to get off the phone.
we really should get off.
i'm hanging up right now.
no, i am.
yeah! let's go, ken, let's go.
go, go, go.
come on, do n't quit on me.
but it's not a fair fight.
you run a rafting company. i sit behind a desk all day.
i'd love to see your ass with a paddle bouncing through a class - four rapid.
if i can whip congress into submission, i'm not afraid of a little white water.
you ca n't tame a rapid, frank.
my heart is beating so fast.
if i have a heart attack it's your fault.
i need another drink.
i think i'll have another, too.
do n't bogart that.
do you think this place made us?
when i walked on campus today i wondered, did it mean anything?
if it's just a place we spent four years of our lives or was there more?
i knew that the moment i saw you cuss out the drill sergeant when we were knobs.
the library is a sham.
higgins asked me a favor, i asked someone else a favor, they slapped my name on it.
or knows how to deliver on them.
in 50 years, they'll just replace it with something else, just like they're doing with this for mine.
the library does n't matter.
but i want to think that this place did.
i think it meant a lot to us, then.
honestly, i have n't really thought about it that much.
it's a long time ago.
we were so close.
we messed around a couple of times.
i was so drawn to you...
i could always make you laugh.
how did we lose touch?
you went to law school. i joined the army.
you ran for congress. i moved to colorado.
thirty years goes by.
i got children older than we were back then.
do you have anyone, frank?
if i want someone, i want them.
it made me happy to make you happy, frank.
did n't see any harm in it.
when you're on the water, all you're thinking about is what's right in front of you.
everything is in the moment.
i do n't really have time to think about the past.
you meant something to me.
i do n't feel so well...
you gonna be sick?
can we just stay here for a little bit?
until i feel better.
it's almost 7:00.
i do n't even remember going to sleep...
1,100 acres of development.
45 shopping and office space.
who is he that they're naming the place after?
some guy who went here.
i think he's dead.
we had to set up the chairs yesterday.
i'm gonna try to get some shut - eye before the ceremony.
i'll see you all later?
hey, frank, before i forget, here's my card, so your money manager can call me.
you look like you're hurting.
it was an all - nighter.
was it fun at least?
i need to get some shut - eye.
remy's staying here.
he harassing you about the donation?
go get some rest.
i was n't a starter, but i got my time on the court.
i think you look sexier now, all grown up.
we're ready for you.
you said two years.
yeah, i think two years is a realistic estimate.
which i think it will.
you think or you know?
i ca n't predict 100, but i'm confident it will.
you think, you're confident, you ca n't predict 100, how does any of that help us?
i'll tell you something, i'm 100 unable to pay my mortgage right now.
i'm 100 unable to buy my kids school supplies.
we supposed to live off my husband's disability?
there'll be paid training programs available.
how much will they pay?
granted, it's less than you made at the shipyard.
it's about 6 an hour.
that's not even minimum wage.
you have to see it as an investment.
the training programs are a valuable resource...
you're not getting it.
i ca n't afford to make investments.
6 an hour puts my family on the street.
what, do you want me to work five jobs?
you want to know what i think?
i think you sit around in washington coming up with all sorts of fancy numbers and solutions that look good on paper, but that does n't cut it for the rest of us.
we do n't eat paper for dinner.
you ca n't put a paper roof over your head.
when we all voted for you, i did n't think that every one of those votes was another nail in our own coffins.
please, everybody, just sit down for 10 minutes, we can go over this proposal point - by - point.
and you can get the information you need to get the resources that you want...
it's like they do n't want to find a solution.
i understand that they're scared, but that does n't mean they ca n't listen...
you do n't know these people, christina.
i worked in your office for three years.
i spoke to them, i took their calls, i replied to their emails...
you did n't grow up with them.
i do n't need to grow up hand - to - mouth to empathize with the fact that...
they're not interested in empathy.
the house keys are in my jacket.
do your homework or sister mary joseph...
do n't lie to me.
i used to use the same ploy with my parents.
we do the homework, and then we eat.
- what do you guys want?
sweetheart, take the kids upstairs.
how'd you get in here?
you still keep the spare key behind the loose brick on the porch.
you break into my house?
we gotta talk, paul.
we talked last night.
i can convince these people, but i need your help.
i do n't want to have to hurt you with my children upstairs, petey.
i do n't want to fight you, petey.
i do n't want to fight you either.
i will, but we do n't have to.
but i could n't forestall the inevitable.
the shipyard was closing.
if not this year, then next, or the year after.
we all know that.
i could have lied to you.
i could have pretended to do more.
but i do n't believe in living in the past.
i only care about the future.
i'm all you've got.
whatever you think of petey, we either go with him or we got nothing.
now does what i'm offering you come anywhere near what you want or deserve?
but you gotta open your eyes and take what's in front of you.
we can build on that.
5,000 jobs becomes 10, then 15.
not in the snap of a finger, but faster than doing nothing will.
can i count on all of you?
all right, i'll take that as a yes.
we'll need your contact information, so we can send you materials to share with your friends.
now, let's talk about the way the money's gonna get phased in.
it's gonna happen in six stages.
left face, forward march.
francis underwood's career, harvard law degree, one of the youngest state legislators in the history of south carolina, a 22 - year veteran of the u. s. congress,
house majority whip, speaks volumes about the values young people learn here at the sentinel, values like honor, duty, discipline, like sacrifice, service and respect.
ladies and gentlemen, the francis j. underwood library.
i wrote a speech.
but i'm not gonna read it.
not even this building.
i do n't mean to sound ungrateful.
i am very grateful, i'm deeply honored,
i had the good fortune of spending most of this weekend with a group of friends.
friends i have n't seen in a very long time.
most of you young cadets probably do n't know who i am.
but i do n't blame you.
when i was your age, why, i did n't care much for what men in gray hair did or what they had to say.
i wish i could describe...
that's the word that's stuck in my mind.
it's not about what's lasting or permanent.
it is about individual voices coming together for a moment,
and that moment lasts the length of a breath.
that's what i think about my time here.
you'll have to forgive me.
you know, when i was a cadet, we could drink all night, then get up in the morning and march 20 miles, but these days i'm lucky i got up these three steps.
i want to thank you very much.
i want to thank president higgins, and of course, the love of my life, claire.
i told you about her yesterday.
hi, mrs. russo.
we just came by to say goodbye.
we have to catch a train in about an hour.
they still have n't fixed that light?
things went well today.
i think the folks in the yard are going to get behind me.
peter did a great job.
hand me that blanket.
ac in here is nuts.
what happened to your hand?
i got in a fight.
that's my peter.
i'm just messing with ya.
hold on a second.
yeah, my mother's in room 409.
she has a light out that needs to be replaced.
all right. i'll take care of it.
what you want me to wear?
the light in my mother's room.
i told you i'll take care of it later.
you'll take care of it now.
you're very welcome, sir.
real proud of you, frank.
i hate to admit it, but i feel the same.
well, having all you here is what made it special.
now, you stay in touch.
see you, buddy.
beautiful ceremony, frank.
yeah, they did a good job.
i'm glad i was here for that.
you should come out to salida sometime.
i'll take you out on the arkansas river.
edward has the car ready.
looks like the shipbuilders are on board.
tomorrow morning we start working on his draft for his announcement speech.
i got that with me.
ride with me to the airport, we can go through it in the car.
want to get a beer?
it's not going to trial, i got it.
checks go to quorta.
you've been re-assigned to skip hadderly.
he must have said something.
he must have given a reason why.
no, he did n't.
he does n't have to.
he just said he wants a new intern.
michael amended his will two months ago.
i'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells within his family.
500,000 was left in the name of chelsea rayne.
are you chelsea rayne?
do n't ever do that again!
i thought that was you.
it's great seeing you.
you look beautiful as always.
pleasure to meet you.
you guys just had lunch?
you should try the sea scallops, they're amazing.
i had them last time.
anyway, i do n't mean to intrude.
i just wanted to say hi.
- it's good seeing you.
i spoke with peter gramercy, off the record.
cilic's kids are now aware that you've been left half - a- million dollars of their father's money, and they're going to fight it.
i could have predicted that.
we should assume they're gonna do their best to expose you as an escort, which could also open you up to criminal charges.
do you know what the estate's worth?
did gramercy tell you?
again, off the record,
and they're willing to drag their father's name through all of this, for a fortieth of the estate?
could be a bluff, but we should err on the side of caution.
what was the name of the man you were with the other day?
no, it's alex.
do you often see older men?
i mean i assume he's a client of yours, right?
can i ask you something?
will you tell me the truth?
what's your real name?
do you like being an escort?
there are four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a two - car garage.
the master bedroom is on the upper level.
the floor to ceiling, wall - to - wall glass provides stunning views of the lake.
would you live here?
are you asking me to move in?
but not bad, though, right?
no, it's beautiful.
some close friends of mine,
steve, and his wife, ana, are throwing a dinner party this thursday.
you'd really like them.
sometimes steve and i do business together and ana owns the cermark, that really cool art gallery in the west loop.
so it's a double date?
if you want to think of it that way.
i told them that we've been seeing each other.
so, will you come?
i mean i have to check my schedule, but i'm sure it's fine.
you make me really happy.
i'm really happy we finally get to meet you.
jack's been talking about you for weeks.
i have n't seen jack this happy in a while.
he does n't deserve you.
you do n't deserve me.
he's the one who should be embarrassed, hiding you away for so long.
do you want to come back to my place?
you're gonna go, now?
i was n't expecting to stay the night.
i have something to take care of in the morning.
i had a wonderful time tonight.
i feel very close to you.
i feel very close to you, too.
will you call me tomorrow?
i need you to do a clearance search on these, asap.
make note of anything that seems even remotely questionable.
hi, what's your name?
hi, corey, i'm christine.
i'm having some trouble accessing some files on the main frame.
may i have your last name?
"reade." with an "e" on the end.
and which files are you trying to access?
i just accessed them yesterday.
you do n't have authorization anymore.
your access has been terminated.
you'll need tellis' approval.
stop touching me there!
i'm sorry, i'm really ticklish.
it's not funny.
oh, absolutely not.
my wife and i used to do this on sailing trips.
i should have said "ex - wife".
no, i just never heard you talk about her before.
i did n't feel like i knew you before.
well, you do now.
i do wish you were a little mad right now.
you want me to trash talk your ex?
no, she's great.
it's always about me.
what's he offering?
can you get it higher?
you wanna come?
i'll watch you.
- you're getting out?
- i'm done.
i was just playing around.
i have something for you.
only if you answer one question.
- when you dunked me...
- no, with the guy.
the guy that you were talking to at the pool.
did you know him?
he asked me if i was alone, i said "no".
were you attracted to him?
just answer the question.
i was n't even paying attention.
i bought the house.
the one overlooking the lake.
i do n't know what to say.
i bought it for us.
so that we'd have a place of our own.
so we did n't have to keep going to hotels.
you can decorate it however you want.
i thought you would like it.
no one's ever done anything like this for me before.
yeah, that should be fine.
i'll just check and get back to you.
last night was incredible.
i'll get back to you about tuesday.
did you leave it upstairs?
i always do this.
can i speak with erin for a moment?
- is it a good time?
i hear you're heading the xhp case now.
i'd love to be involved and help in any way i can.
i was involved when david was heading it and i'd like to see it through.
it's a bit of a mess right now, but i'll see what i can do.
if they were smart, you'd be the new managing partner.
is everything okay between you and david?
so, how's work?
they're on a hiring freeze.
less positions, more profits.
- who knows how long...
- where do you intern again?
a small law firm in midtown.
peters and morgan. it's two guys.
it turns you on.
it turns me on.
how did you get this number?
you gave it to me.
i did n't give you this number, jack.
congrats on the promotion.
so my phone got stolen.
and my sister got some weird texts.
so if you got any weird messages...
- well, great news for you.
hey, i did n't hear from you yesterday and i got worried...
never call me again!
hull breach in sector seven!
our ship was the only one that could lock onto megatron's warp signature.
shields are doing a major fade!
their shields are down!
launch all pods. get them in safe orbit!
is this the right planet?
field readings are off the scale.
continued exposure to robotic forms will result in permanent damage.
then we will create alternate forms based on the most powerful local creatures!
how's about i cut meeces to pieces?
living large is for forms like me rhinox.
we may need energon for power, but this is too much of a good thing
our robot forms will start to short out after a few minutes' exposure.
this is one unusual planet whatever it is.
the transwarp drive can go through space an' time.
we were locked onto megatron's warp signature.
we could be anyplace anytime.
and our crew is orbiting the planet in those stasis pods we lost in battle.
they're protected from the energon fields but it means megatron has us outnumbered.
this can not be earth!
not only did you fail to destroy the maximals when you had the chance you failed to bring us to the right planet!
you are an idiot and an incompetent leader.
and i - am taking over!
the winner shall lead the predacons
- and the loser shall be destroyed!
there is more to being a leader than simple courage.
what does it matter which planet we are on?
enough energon to power the predacons' entire galactic conquest!
only the maximals could give us trouble now if they survived the crash.
and if you find them - destroy them!
all this fer a golden disk.
it gave the location of a major energon source.
that's why megatron stole it. yeah, like i care!
playing galactic patrol was n't nowhere in my job description.
we ca n't let that happen. besides, you wanted exploration, and here we are on an unknown planet.
just no pleasing some people.
they're fast, all right. you chose a good form. hey, you think that's speed?
you ai n't seen the golden rocket.
return to base immediately!
we do n't have time for this!
no good. th' energon fields mess up th' comlinks.
anything over a hundred meters they ai n't worth scrap.
so this yer first day on th' job or what?
it's just a big bug.
hm. the way those two reacted that's no natural life - form.
and if we're talking unnatural life - forms, then we gotta be talking about just one thing.
time for this cat to pounce!
we'll swat that pesky predacon!
there has been peace between the maximals and predacons for centuries.
for the right moment -- to strike!
ya mean like this?
i'm - i'm stuck!
we'll cover you!
do not let them escape!
energon field build - up.
i am commander of this group.
so i get vaped because you're too chicken to go yourself?
but i was capable of giving you better cover fire.
it will take time for our beast forms to effect internal repairs.
maybe he was destroyed in th' crash.
i have left the predacons to join your group - as leader.
did i hear the word 'leader'?
this guy's got bearings of chrome steel.
and the loser - shall be destroyed!
time's running out, is n't it?
we got nothing but time, asshole.
your boys think you're in here with your bodyguard.
how you gonna get out of here, genius?
you even think about that?
just like a couple of geckos.
what did you say to me?
it's the labyrinth, man.
killing boss hogg might be the wrong move.
do n't let it push your buttons.
well, maybe i'll let it show me the truth from inside your screwed - up head.
he did n't burn up on the couch.
you doused him with lighter fluid while he was drunk.
now will you let me get back to work?
just get it open.
tell them you're fine.
hang back, boys!
even a blind squirrel finds an occasional testicle, does n't he?
what do you know?
this has got to be it.
it's got to be what?
this door handle, or whatever the hell it is, is how we started this hall of mirrors in the first place.
we found the sasak ukib.
richie, what are you doing?
jesus christ, richie!
the serpent is filled with her blood.
i knew that it was coming.
well, i did n't.
that's our way to the top.
you still got that 30 mill strapped to yourself?
it's time to settle up.
i do n't know who you are anymore.
i do n't know what you are.
i guess i'm just the guy who killed dad.
scott, your sister's in danger.
i can take care of this if you want me to.
go find my daughter.
carlos wanted you here for a reason.
your blood is so pure.
at least for now, before they realize that their precious santanico is gone.
it's all you.
who would n't want to eat all that filling?
welcome to the party sherrif.
that's why you did n't get affected by the queen's bite.
i've read about you.
you got a hell of a bloodline there, compadre.
it was you the whole time.
well, only one way to carnegie hall, and that's practice, practice...
i'm not a sheriff.
did you find scott?
you may feel like you're greater than human, but you're not.
this is n't you.
and i just saved your life.
scott, something evil and vicious has taken hold of you.
you're gonna have to feed on innocent blood to survive.
you wo n't be able to live with yourself.
stop being a goddamn pastor!
i never really was a part of this family!
you're a child of god.
and i want you to find peace in heaven.
not if you've killed so many.
we came here to be a family again.
we still can be.
you think you can slaughter the counselors and the lords will stand for it?
by the time i'm finished with them, they wo n't be standing at all.
you're gonna start the revolution.
why do n't you write a song about it?
wrap a snake around your tits and dance.
that's all you're good for.
what's with all the shouting?
narciso's a stand - up guy.
he saved my ass once.
welcome to the twister.
can i get you anything?
you know what i want?
i want a gold medal.
i want a podium.
i want to hear the national anthem playing while the goddamn blue angels fly over my head, and then i think i want to be on some cereal boxes, because in case you have n't noticed, carlito,
i got it.
you're forgetting about something.
the bonds are in a safe place.
that's exactly where they're gonna stay.
what are you talking about, seth?
i'm talking about my take, richard, for this whole miserable job.
two jobs, actually...
the bank robbery that nearly got me killed and your little imaginary heist that nearly got me buried...
so you're just gonna take my money, too?
slithering around in your gullet.
this is where i get off.
your brother and i need that money.
think my brother's gonna be just fine without it.
- well, i wo n't be.
she's your boss, not mine.
when you bite someone, it's like...
it's like you can feel their life run right through you.
it's because blood is the conduit of the soul.
it's what makes us human.
she needed help, and you just left it all in god's hands.
your mother made her choice.
what she did, she did to herself.
no, it was your fault.
he did n't, scott.
i know the truth.
he suffered all alone for us, scott.
like he always does.
scott, what did you do?
come on, dad.
come on, pastor.
no, daddy, stop.
where do you want to go?
we came here to find a new path, and look...
what is, scott?
you gonna turn us all into monsters?
are you gonna turn me into a monster?
you gonna turn me into a monster, like you?
kate, do n't!
- scott, no.
you guys deserve each other.
katey, you listen to me...
i wo n't let him near us.
if he's gonna survive, he needs you.
you need each other.
and what about you?
your brother's right.
you ca n't go back to bethel.
and i do n't think your dad can go back, either.
you know how this has to end.
well, i guess uncle eddie was right.
i thought you were leaving.
it's one thing to ditch your brother, another to leave him outnumbered in a fight.
you do n't really expect to walk out of here?
it was a goddamn bloodsucker rave, and i'm still standing.
so i'm warning you, slick...
you better find another way to make some cash, 'cause today ai n't your payday.
tell us where the bonds are.
let's finish this without bloodshed.
you kill me, you're never gonna find out.
you're jealous, carlos, so you make a deal with my captors?
do n't be so angry, mi amor.
"find their gods... and you'll find their gold."
that's what i believed.
i had found love.
i never stopped loving you.
do not lie to me!
i could never hate you as much as you hate yourself.
i did everything for you.
i slaughtered my own men, i betrayed my god.
so you can go to bed with this pinche criminal?
the venom will cripple him.
but it will keep what's inside of him alive until i decide to set you free.
perhaps i'll make you my slave now.
who you calling a criminal, asshole?
you still think i'm a slave.
in here, i'm the queen!
it's all your fault.
excuse me, my fault?
you wanted to leave with all the money.
because it's my money.
oh, trust me... i saw.
richie already told me all about you and carlito.
he double - crossed me with the same monsters who imprisoned me here.
what would seth gecko do if he got betrayed like this?
you turned my brother into a goddamn slave.
he's not a slave!
how can i imprison someone when i've been in chains my whole life?
you're the victim.
- i'm no one's victim.
carlos is gonna call you.
he's gonna offer you a deal.
i want my freedom.
that much, i deserve.
well, you do n't have the money yet, do you?
who else, narciso, has so consistently provided for the nine houses? hmm?
i have always provided for them.
you are going to tell them that santanico was the one that betrayed us.
you are going bring them the 30 million prize.
seth thinks it's just about the money, but those oil bonds are the key to so much more.
i can walk right out that door with the 30 mill, and you ca n't even follow me.
you would n't do that to richard.
i know what he did to your father, seth.
i need your brother, seth.
i ca n't bring down the nine lords without him.
i do n't care about your stupid crusade.
oh, but you will.
the nine houses may live in the shadows, seth, but they have great power in this realm.
they have more wealth than you can even imagine.
i already got what i need.
it's never enough.
you do n't love the money.
you love stealing it.
richard killed your father for a reason.
well, why do n't you forgive whoever threw you in this hole, sweetheart?
well, this is a nice change.
i spend all day chasing you down.
now you're calling me.
what do you know?
you got 10 minutes, seth.
then after that, it's one finger for each minute.
and then, after that, it's one stake through his heart.
did you hear me, seth?
there's all kinds of markings on these walls.
if this is where those things get made, maybe they can get unmade.
you really can see it.
our life... the future.
you really can see us being happy again.
i believe it's possible.
that's the trick, is n't it?
we ca n't stop.
- i'm sorry, katey - kakes.
i might even destroy it.
this whole future that you see... it can not be.
ranger gonzalez, help me.
kate, all i can tell you is what i've learned on the job.
day in and day out, people like you, the victim...
there's one thing that's really important to them.
you do n't want to see me turn into a demon from hell.
and i do n't want to be one.
i wo n't do it.
i'm not gonna learn how to survive with it.
he's not set in his ways.
but i can not abide killing another human being.
now you're just being selfish!
you're so selfish.
you just want to go to heaven so you can be with mama.
i'm not so sure she's gonna be there.
she tried to kill herself.
god, you ca n't believe that.
he does n't live on the pages of some book.
now, you hold on a second.
no, he does n't.
this whole trip's been about... trying to find him.
who knew i'd find him in the walls of this... pagan temple...
and in my baby girl's eyes?
yes, i do.
i love you, katey - kakes.
technically, it's only 26 million, but carlos does n't need to know that.
are you certain about using the real thing?
first thing carlito's gonna do is check.
you just got to make sure your girls know what to do.
do you think it's possible for someone to change their fate?
i think you're well on your way, sister.
i mean, anybody crosses you, you can rip their guts out with your bare hands, right?
it's our fate to live in the shadows.
well, maybe you ought to stop destroying people's lives.
i do what i do to survive.
i was wrong about you.
save it, okay?
not gonna work on this gecko.
you saved him from a lifetime of agony.
he's at peace with mama.
that's what he wanted.
maybe that's what god wanted.
i've had this feeling all day.
felt like that since the liquor store this morning.
like... somebody's been leading me down a path.
carlos spelled it out for me.
said i was part of a war that i can never escape... that i'd pay the price... that i'd lose my wife and daughter.
and you'd believe that man before you believe your own heart?
i hope my billy grows up to be like you.
are you being held in here?
six months of rehab, and i'm back on track.
the system took me in when my mom fell so far off the wagon, she fell 6 feet under.
it's all right now, though.
i've got it all figured out.
got what figured out?
exactly where to go with my life from here.
i'm not gonna let my daddy's ghost haunt me anymore.
my daddy walked out the day before i was supposed to be baptized.
and my mom was so screwed up by it, she never got around to doing it.
so today, i'm finally being baptized.
yeah, this place will do that to you.
i do n't know about you, but i'm famished.
you know, narciso has a cook with him at all times.
el pinche flaco does n't put on weight.
you do n't look so good.
you're hungry, are n't you?
i fed in the labyrinth.
yeah, you imagined feeding in the labyrinth.
and now that you're the prince, you got to stay in shape, bro.
she will tire of you, even if it takes five centuries.
you know, i provided many services to the lords.
you guys look like you're about to get into an underwear - only pillow fight.
carlito, i got to tell you, the sun can not come up fast enough on this day.
as long as he stops screwing this up, maybe.
you know, it's funny this whole thing kind of reminds me of this job that we pulled about seven years ago in cheyenne.
yeah, it did n't just go sideways. it went three ways.
we pulled it off, though, did n't we, brother?
you remember cheyenne, do n't you?
let's get this over with.
- soon as you uncuff him, we'll talk.
do n't go near him, carlos.
he's gonna get me killed.
he's gonna try something like phoenix six years ago.
- it was n't as crazy as cheyenne.
- forget about cheyenne!
i ca n't believe you sold us out to get in bed with these freaks.
not my fault you ca n't see the big picture, brother.
i'm learning, fast!
you do n't learn.
- gentlemen, please!
let him go. i'll hand it over.
he beat you on the daily, and you give him a pass and not me?
- he's blood.
they did n't know what hit'em.
yeah, i know the feeling.
you're not gonna turn.
i did n't pump any venom into you.
look, i had a plan, richard...
why could n't you just trust me?
because in cheyenne, we had an argument.
it needed to be more than that.
in phoenix, we let the pricks think that i killed you.
well, in phoenix, you were n't a goddamn succubus, were you?
boys, it's time. aah!
told you it was gonna be a long day.
you're gonna pay for the trail of bodies you left behind today, going all the way back to earl.
or i'll put this stake through his goddamn heart.
what are you, nuts?
why are you hesitating, rinche, hmm?
that's what your bloodline is begging you to do, and yet you ca n't do it.
maybe he does n't have the stones.
you want to save your family from what's coming?
you're making a big mistake, ranger.
i'm gonna drop this stake, and i'm gonna walk out of here.
and none of you freaks better come after me or my family...
i'm cool if you're cool.
you can keep that.
what about richie and seth?
i have a feeling whatever they're into, they're never gonna be free of.
be able to get back on your own?
honestly, i have no idea where i'm going.
but i think, after tonight, i'm gonna be fine.
take care of yourself, kate.
you take care of your little girl.
well, if that do n't get me religion, i do n't know what will.
you ca n't walk in the sun.
you said you were always just trying to save me, seth.
now you have to let me go.
buddy, we just pulled it off out there.
if it was, you would've just taken the money.
you ever find that beach and blue agave, you let me know.
maybe i'll come join you.
but not in that.
we should be hunting her down.
eh, sorry, carlitos, but the order comes straight from on high.
yeah, they love their games, even if they did just lose.
you know i'll never make it out.
is it a birthday party?
mom, this is n't a "star wars" cake.
yes, it is.
that's the "star wars" bear.
no, no, that's not a good name.
you know, i knew a greek bear once.
you're right, louis.
i am good at throwing parties.
- uh, i did n't say anything
- look at the pinata.
it's in great shape.
no one can tell we've used it since eddie was 2.
this year, i filled it with cereal.
how much wrapping paper did you guys use?
we got him pogs.
is the camera okay?
i fell on a hot wheel.
before we start yelling, just remember, the force works in mysterious ways.
eddie's birthday is next week.
it's time to start repairing the decorations.
all the other guys are still there, unrolling their sleeping bags, but not me.
you will thank me when you do n't get pedophiled.
are those the birthday - party decorations?
i do n't want a party this year.
i'm almost a teenager.
so no party at all?
it's okay, mom.
i know they take you so long to make.
no need to do anything special.
i'm glad we did this.
so, how do we feel about this?
and we'll have a free saturday.
we can go to work.
i have n't gotten to work on a saturday in years!
let's carry eddie's present down together.
where are all the streamers and scallion pancakes and birthday hats?
we're not doing a party this year.
you know that, right?
why did n't you tell us there was no party?
because we're your parents.
we do n't have to tell you things.
remember, no gyros from the food court.
i do n't trust meat without bones.
i do n't smell any poison.
the termite guy said we would n't smell anything.
i thought you were n't gonna come today because you were busy celebrating eddie's birthday.
eddie said he did n't want a birthday party this year.
so, this year, i showed up with horses, and we rode them to the olive garden.
i would n't joke about that, louis.
flew right into the sun.
let's go find eddie.
i miss how serious he looks when he makes a wish.
it is special when he concentrates.
louis, his friends threw him a surprise birthday party.
mitch, you came!
i would n't miss your dirty dozen.
you know, i've been thinking, we're such good kids that mom and dad forget about us.
that's why they did n't tell us that they cancelled eddie's party.
i'm sick of being a good boy.
why do i always hurt the ones i love?
maybe we should start being bad.
let's ask mom if it's okay.
do you remember where we parked the car?
rated pg - 13.
sounds pretty "chill."
evan and i saw a movie today.
a pg - 13 movie.
it was unsuitable for ages under 13.
we saw you, eddie!
and why was mitch there?
oh, so you did want a party!
you just did n't want to have it with us.
you're embarrassed of us, you and mitch.
i'm not embarrassed!
we would have been happy to host your friends here.
it's just different when you're around.
oh, but not when mitch is around?
you're yourself with us, with the rap music and the sleeping.
you guys have this idea of me, but i'm more than just that.
well, how are you different around your friends?
be that way at home, then!
there's so many rules around here, i can never relax!
you only have one self.
i am always myself.
it does n't matter where i am.
i'm not so good.
would a good kid do this?
react! this is not okay!
you think eddie's right, do n't you?
you think we're too strict.
i think we're good parents.
our rules are there for a reason.
i liked you better when you were worried about mitch.
they've talked like three times!
we have to up our game.
what's up, jessica?
is eddie in the kitchen?
it's like we're ghosts.
how about pop-tarts instead?
you said you would n't buy those because preservatives make you go blind.
are you guys getting a divorce?
can i stop wearing underwear?
i will go tonight.
i do n't trust dave.
his own father does n't want to sleep there.
you can sleep over at dave's.
i will just stand outside and look in the window.
he'll just be three houses down.
have a great time, son.
until he comes home.
i just cracked you a cold one.
dude, my mom does n't care.
are you looking at him?
okay. watch him take them.
i'll be sure he takes his vitamins before bed.
you have a dog?
yeah, my mom just found him on the bus.
after the best instrument.
how about this instrument?
once we run away, they'll really be sorry.
i heard their cheesesteaks are amazing.
i wo n't disturb you.
take all the time you need.
i just want to see if i could see my son at dave's house through your living - room window.
is she holding up?
he loved you very much.
is my wife here?
jessica, what are you doing?
i'm just making sure he's okay.
he's never gonna know.
whatever's easiest for you.
light swords in the house.
looks like he's having fun.
that's what we wanted.
your brother's dead.
and the huangs are here.
i'd never be able to play this game at home.
pause, pause, pause.
that cereal is made of little cookies!
dude, this is our dinner.
i love the way you live.
not for long, though.
dude, you're getting ice cream on my pillow!
just rub it in.
- go to bed, damnit.
- i hate you back!
i wish you were dead!
oh, put it on your christmas wish list!
if i talked to my mom that way, she'd kill me.
and then i would be killed.
that's not weird.
what's weird about my house?
dude, you fart on your mom!
i just wanted to come home.
and then... i did n't.
i like being with my friends, but i like being at home, too.
do you want me to make you birthday noodles?
does n't that take like six hours?
it is for my son.
are those eddie's birthday noodles?
what are you doing up so late?
wait. where are you going?
it took me six hours to make these noodles.
noodles, then bed, then grounded.
your noodles or your rules.
chew with your mouth closed.
so i said, "ma' am, you can stay, but your dog's got to go."
when did you guys become friends?
well, we were in the service together.
what are you talking about?
an old man with dementia staped me on the street
i have to form myself, as i have never really formed before, and try to help you to form some sort of reasoned estimate of the most romantic figure in the recent history of mathematics.
ramanujan was an indian, and i suppose that it is always a little difficult for an englishman and an indian to understand one another properly.
i owe more to him than to anyone else in the world, and my association with him is the one romantic incident of my life.
he was, in a way, my discovery.
i did not invent him.
the difficulty for me, then, is not that i do not know enough about him, but that i know and feel too much.
you can also see i've been conducting my own mathematical researches.
you've no degree.
i'll write you a recommendation.
with all due respect, sir, i have recommendations.
what i need is a job.
i have a wife.
you people are all the same.
i'm doomed, like galileo.
he died in poverty, you know.
whatever is written in your fate will happen.
you ca n't change that.
my fate is to have a wife who lives with my mother while i sleep here with you all because the british think i'm a raving lunatic.
as do we indians.
where did you get your degree?
i do n't have one.
- how many do you have?
- who else have you shown this to?
they all send me to someone else.
i can offer you a job, but your evenings will have to be spent in helping me understand this.
- most certainly, sir.
send for your wife so you can be together.
and put this on.
sir francis, here are today's ledgers.
narayana, how long have you worked for me?
since i helped to design the bridge on the godavari, which now requires me to call you "sir".
- get him out of here.
forgive my appearance, but i really am quite exceptional with numbers.
what you might see now is ordinary glass, i promise you will soon remain to see a diamond.
your accounts had better be half as polished as your ego.
amma, this is it.
it's the best i could do for now.
it's a home.
i will sleep on the floor.
i have to go back to work now.
why are n't you using the abacus?
it was faster in my head.
if sir francis comes here, at least pretend to use this.
i see you've been working on your own formulas.
paper is a precious commodity here.
ramanujan, we need to seek an audience with someone who really understands all this.
i've been to everyone in madras.
did you know that the name derives from mandarajya?
"the realm of the stupid."
there's a whole world out there.
and there's england.
you do n't come home.
it is i who owe the apology for keeping him.
i think it's enough for tonight, ramanujan.
i was told you love numbers more than people.
perhaps we can start over.
and i am your wife.
what does it all do?
it's like a painting, i think.
only imagine it is with colors you can not see.
what good is that?
not much for you, i'm afraid.
but for me it is everything.
maybe there is someone else who can see and understand it as well.
and for them it will be important.
have you met them?
i want to understand more than just colors i ca n't see.
what do you see?
imagine, if we could look so closely, we could see each grain, each particle.
you see, there are patterns in everything.
the reflections on water.
in maths, these patterns reveal themselves in the most incredible form.
you should sleep in the bed.
i have made a friend in my boss.
he's going to find somebody to understand my work outside madras.
that is an honor.
what nonsense are you talking?
he surely sees enough of you.
you're never here at home.
ramanujan, listen to me.
this work is too important to die with you.
it must be published.
if you, an indian, are at the pinnacle with these formulas, then the british, even while they subjugate us, must recognize that our brightest matches theirs.
you have been alone in your mind your whole life.
now other people have the chance to understand you.
not just your namagiri.
all i do is imagine.
he's a real pot stirrer.
you know, he single - handedly reformed the entire tripos examination system.
turned over hundreds of years of history.
he's your man.
kings, prime ministers.
now perhaps even you.
trouble on the continent?
we beat the frogs by a goal at twickenham.
ah, the balkans.
you've got one there seems particularly well traveled.
do you think it's another hoax?
"i beg to introduce myself as a clerk in the accounts department."
- what this time?
- quite impressive, really.
someone's gone to a lot of trouble.
and who claims he can give meaning to the negative values of the gamma function.
you know, littlewood, this year alone, i've received correspondence from those who profess to prove the prophetic wisdom of the pyramids, the revelations of the elders of zion,
but a letter from an ill - educated indian clerk in madras, challenging assertions i made in the tracts series, really takes the biscuit.
well, i have to say, i've made similar assertions myself.
